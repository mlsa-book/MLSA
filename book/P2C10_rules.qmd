# Scoring Rules {#sec-eval-distr}

{{< include _wip_minor.qmd >}}

Scoring rules evaluate probabilistic predictions and (attempt to) measure the overall predictive ability of a model in terms of both calibration and discrimination [@Gneiting2007; @Murphy1973].
In contrast to calibration measures, which assess the average performance across all observations on a population level, scoring rules evaluate the sample mean of individual predictions across all observations in a test set.
As well as being able to provide information at an individual level, scoring rules are also popular as probabilistic forecasts are widely recognised to be superior to deterministic predictions for capturing uncertainty in predictions [@Dawid1984; @Dawid1986].
Formalisation and development of scoring rules has primarily been due to Dawid [@Dawid1984; @Dawid1986; @Dawid2014] and Gneiting and Raftery [@Gneiting2007]; though the earliest measures promoting "rational" and "honest" decision making date back to the 1950s [@Brier1950; @Good1952].
Few scoring rules have been proposed in survival analysis, although the past few years have seen an increase in popularity in these measures.
Before delving into these measures, we will first describe scoring rules in the simpler classification setting.

Scoring rules are pointwise losses, which means a loss is calculated for all observations and the sample mean is taken as the final score.
To simplify notation, we only discuss scoring rules in the context of a single observation where $L_i(\hatS_i, t_i, \delta_i)$ would be the loss calculated for some observation $i$ where $\hatS_i$ is the predicted survival function (from which other distribution functions can be derived), and $(t_i, \delta_i)$ is the observed survival outcome.

## Classification Losses

In the simplest terms, a scoring rule compares two values and assigns them a score (hence 'scoring rule'), formally we'd write $L: \Reals \times \Reals \mapsto \ExtReals$.
In machine learning, this usually means comparing a prediction for an observation to the ground truth, so $L: \Reals \times \calP \mapsto \ExtReals$ where $\calP$ is a set of distributions.
Crucially, scoring rules usually refer to comparisons of true and predicted *distributions*.
As an example, take the Brier score [@Brier1950] defined by:
$$L_{Brier}(\hatp_i, y_i) = (y_i - \hatp_i(y_i))^2$$

This scoring rule compares the ground truth to the predicted probability distribution by testing if the difference between the observed event and the truth is minimized.
This is intuitive as if the event occurs and $y_i = 1$, then $\hatp_i(y_i)$ should be as close to one as possible to minimize the loss.
On the other hand, if $y_i = 0$ then the better prediction would be $\hatp_i(y_i) = 0$.

This demonstrates an important property of the scoring rule, *properness*.
A loss is *proper*, if it is minimized by the correct prediction.
In contrast, the loss $L_{improper}(\hatp_i, y_i) = 1 - L_{Brier}(\hatp_i, y_i)$ is still a scoring rule as it compares the ground truth to the prediction probability distribution, but it is clearly improper as the perfect prediction ($\hatp_i(y_i) = y_i$) would result in a score of $1$ whereas the worst prediction would result in a score or $0$.
Proper losses provide a method of model comparison as, by definition, predictions closest to the true distribution will result in lower expected losses.

Another important property is *strict* properness.
A loss is *strictly proper* if the loss is uniquely minimized by the 'correct' prediction.
Consider now the loss $L_0(\hatp_i, y_i) = 0$.
Not only is this a strictly proper scoring rule but it is also proper.
The loss can only take the value $0$ and is therefore guaranteed to be minimized by the correct prediction.
It is clear however that this loss is useless.
In contrast, the Brier score is minimized by only one value, which is the optimal prediction ([@fig-eval-brierlog]).
Strictly proper losses are particular important for automated model optimisation, as minimization of the loss will result in the 'optimum score estimator based on the scoring rule' [@Gneiting2007].

Mathematically, a classification loss  $L: \calP \times \calY \rightarrow \ExtReals$ is *proper* if for any distributions $p_Y,p$ in $\calP$ and for any random variables $Y \sim p_Y$, it holds that $\EE[L(p_Y, Y)] \leq \EE[L(p, Y)]$.
The loss is *strictly proper* if, in addition, $p = p_Y$ uniquely minimizes the loss.

As well as the Brier score, which was defined above, another widely used loss is the log loss [@Good1952], defined by

$$
L_{logloss}(\hatp_i, y_i) = -\log \hat{p}_i(y_i)
$$ {#eq-logloss}

These losses are visualised in @fig-eval-brierlog, which highlights that both losses are strictly proper [@Dawid2014] as they are minimized when the true prediction is made, and converge to the minimum as predictions are increasingly improved.

## Survival Losses {#sec-eval-distr-commonsurv}

<!-- FIXME: COPY FINAL DEFINITION FROM PROPERNESS PAPER -->
Analogously to classification losses, a survival loss $L: \calP \times \PReals \times \bset \rightarrow \ExtReals$ is *proper* if for any distributions $p_Y, p$ in $\calP$, and for any random variables $Y \sim p_Y$, and $C$ t.v.i. $\PReals$; with $T := \min(Y,C)$ and $\Delta := \II(T=Y)$; it holds that, $\EE[L(p_Y, T, \Delta)] \leq \EE[L(p, T, \Delta)]$.
The loss is *strictly proper* if, in addition, $p = p_Y$ uniquely minimizes the loss. A survival loss is referred to as outcome-independent (strictly) proper if it is only (strictly) proper when $C$ and $Y$ are independent.

With these definitions, the rest of this chapter lists common scoring rules in survival analysis and discusses some of their properties.
As with other chapters, this list is likely not exhaustive but will cover commonly used losses.
The losses are grouped into squared losses, absolute losses, and logarithmic losses, which respectively estimate the mean squared error, mean absolute error, and logloss in uncensored settings.

### Squared Losses

The Integrated Graf Score (IGS) was introduced by Graf [@Graf1995; @Graf1999] as an analogue to the integrated brier score (IBS) in regression.
It is likely the commonly used scoring rule in survival analysis, possibly due to its intuitive interpretation.

The loss is defined by

$$
\begin{split}
L_{IGS}(\tau, \hat{S}_i, t_i, \delta_i|\KMG) = \int^{\tau^*}_0  \frac{\hatS_i^2(\tau) \II(t_i \leq \tau, \delta_i=1)}{\KMG(t_i)} + \frac{\hatF_i^2(\tau) \II(t_i > \tau)}{\KMG(\tau)} \ d\tau
\end{split}
$$ {#eq-igs}
where  $\hatS_i^2(\tau) = (\hatS_i(\tau))^2$ and $\hatF_i^2(\tau) = (1 - \hatS_i(\tau))^2$, and $\tau^* \in \NNReals$ is an upper threshold to compute the loss up to, and $\KMG$ is the Kaplan-Meier trained on the censoring distribution for IPCW (@sec-eval-crank-disc-conc).

At first glance this might seem intimidating but it is worth taking the time to understand the intuition behind the loss.
Recall the classification Brier score, $L(\hatp_i, y_i) = (y_i - \hatp_i(y))^2$, this provides a method to evaluate a probability mass function at one point.
In a regression setting, the *integrated Brier score* (IBS), also known as the *CRPS*, is the integral of the Brier score for all real-valued thresholds [@Gneiting2007] and hence allows predictions to be evaluated over multiple points as

$$
L(\hatF_i, y_i) = \int (\II(y_i \leq \tau) - \hatF_i(\tau))^2 \ d\tau
$$ {#eq-crps}

where $\hatF_i$ is the predicted cumulative distribution function and $\tau$ is some meaningful threshold.
As the left-hand indicator can only take one of two values @eq-crps can be represented as two distinct cases, now using $t$ instead of $y$ to represent time:

$$
L(\hatF_i, t_i) =
\begin{cases}
(1 - \hatF_i(\tau))^2 = \int \hatS_i^2(\tau) \ d\tau, & \text{ if } t_i \leq \tau \\
(0 - \hatF_i(\tau))^2 = \int \hatF_i^2(\tau) \ d\tau, & \text{ if } t_i > \tau
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-graf-cases}

In the first case, the observation experienced the event before $\tau$, hence the optimal prediction for $\hatF(\tau)$ (the probability of experiencing the event before $\tau$) is $1$, and therefore the optimal $\hatS(\tau)$ is $0$.
Conversely, in the second case has not experienced the event yet, the optimal $\hatF(\tau)$ is $0$.
The loss therefore meaningfully represents the ideal predictions in the two possible real-world scenarios.

The final component of the loss is accommodating for censoring.
At $\tau$ an observation will either have:

1. Not experienced any outcome --- $t_i > \tau$;
2. Experienced the event --- $t_i \leq \tau \wedge \delta_i = 1$; or
3. Been censored --- $t_i \leq \tau \wedge \delta_i = 0$

Censored observations are discarded after the censoring time as evaluating predictions after this time is impossible as the ground truth is unknown.
To compensate for removing observations, IPCW (@sec-eval-crank-conc) is again used to increasingly weight predictions as $\tau$ increases.
IPC weights, $W_i$ are defined such that observations are either weighted by $G(\tau)$ when they have not yet experienced the event or by their final observed time, $G(t_i)$, otherwise.

$$
W_i =
\begin{cases}
\KMG^{-1}(t_i), & \text{ if } \II(t_i \leq \tau, \delta_i = 1) \\
\KMG^{-1}(\tau), & \text{ if } \II(t_i > \tau)
\end{cases}
$$

The weights total $1$ when divided over all samples and summed [@Graf1999].

As well as being intuitive, when censoring is uninformative, the Graf score consistently estimates the mean square error [@Gerds2006].
However, despite these promising properties, the IGS is improper and must therefore be used with care [@Rindt2022].
Adaptations to the loss, such as the reweighted Graf score [@Sonabend2022b] could be used instead, however the IGS is now deeply embedded in the literature and experiments have demonstrated that the effect of improperness is minimal -- therefore this loss should be avoided for automated routines such as model tuning, however it can still be used for model evaluation.

### Logarithmic losses

The development of logarithmic losses follows from adapting the negative likelihood for censored datasets.
Consider the usual negative likelihood in a regression setting, which is a standard measure for evaluating a model's performance:

$$
L_{NLL}(\hatf_i, y_i) = -\log[\hatf(y_i)]
$$

for a predicted density function $\hatf_i$ and true outcome $y_i$.
Note this is analagous to the classification log loss in @eq-logloss with the probably mass function replaced with the density function.

Now recall @eq-objective-function from @sec-surv-obj, which gives the contribution from a single observation as

$$
\mathcal{L}(t_i) \propto
\begin{dcases}
f(t_i), & \text{ if $i$ is uncensored } \\
S(t_i), & \text{ if $i$ is right-censored } \\
F(t_i), & \text{ if $i$ is left-censored } \\
S(l_i)-S(r_i), & \text{ if $i$ is interval-censored } \\
\end{dcases}
$$
where $r_i, l_i$ are the boundaries on interval-censoring With these values being inflated using the equations in (@sec-surv-obj) if truncation is present.

The log-loss can then be constructed depending on what type of censoring or truncation is present in the data.
For example, if only right-censoring is present then the right-censored logloss (RCLL) is defined as:

$$
L_{RCLL}(\hatS_i, t_i, \delta_i) = -\log[\delta_i\hatf_i(t_i) + (1-\delta_i)\hatS_i(t_i)]
$$

This is an outcome-independent strictly proper scoring rule [@Avati2020] that is clearly derived from the results above and is highly interpretable as a measure of predictive performance when broken down into its two halves:

1. If an observation is censored at $t_i$ then all the information we have is that they did not experience the event at the time, so they must be 'alive', hence the optimal value is $\hatS_i(t_i) = 1$ (which becomes $-\log(1) = 0$).
2. If an observation experiences the event then the 'best' prediction is for the probability of the event at that time to be maximised, as pdfs are not upper-bounded this means $\hatf_i(t_i) = \infty$ (and $-\log(t_i) \rightarrow \infty$ as $t_i \rightarrow \infty$).

Analagous losses follow when left- and/or interval-censoring is present.

Other logarithmic losses have also been proposed, such as the integrated survival log loss (ISLL) in @Graf1999.
However, there is no evidence that this is used in practice nor that it yields any benefit over other, more common, losses.

### Absolute Losses

The final class of losses considered estimate the mean absolute error in an uncensored setting.
The absolute survival loss, developed over time by @Schemper2000 and @Schmid2011, is based on the mean absolute error is very similar to the IGS but removes the squared term:

$$
L_{ASL}(\hatS_i, t_i, \delta_i|\KMG) = \int^{\tau^*}_0 \frac{\hatS_i(\tau)\II(t_i \leq \tau, \delta_i = 1)}{\KMG(t_i)} + \frac{\hatF_i(\tau)\II(t_i > \tau)}{\KMG(\tau)} \ d\tau
$$
where $\KMG$ and $\tau^*$ are as defined above.
Analogously to the IGS, the ASL score consistently estimates the mean absolute error when censoring is uninformative [@Schmid2011] but there are also no proofs or claims of properness.
The ASL and IGS tend to yield similar results [@Schmid2011] but in practice there is no evidence of the ASL being widely used.

## Prediction Error Curves {#sec-pecs}

<!-- FIXME - UNCHANGED FROM THESIS. I THINK FINE FOR NOW BUT NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN IN THE FUTURE (MAINLY TO AVOID SELF PLAGIARISM) -->
As well as evaluating probabilistic outcomes with integrated scoring rules, non-integrated scoring rules can be utilised for evaluating distributions at a single point.
For example, instead of evaluating a probabilistic prediction with the IGS over $\NNReals$, instead one could compute the IGS at a single time-point, $\tau \in \NNReals$, only.
Plotting these for varying values of $\tau$ results in 'prediction error curves' (PECs), which provide a simple visualisation for how predictions vary over the outcome.
PECs are especially useful for survival predictions as they can visualise the prediction 'over time'.
PECs are mostly used as a graphical guide when comparing few models, rather than as a formal tool for model comparison.
An example for PECs is provided in @fig-eval-pecs for the IGS where the the Cox PH consistently outperforms the SVM.

![Prediction error curves for the CPH and SVM models from @sec-eval-distr-calib. x-axis is time and y-axis is the IGS computed at different time-points. The CPH (red) performs better than the SVM (blue) as it scores consistently lower.

## Baselines and ERV {#sec-eval-distr-score-base}

A common criticism of scoring rules is a lack of interpretability, for example, an IGS of 0.5 or 0.0005 has no meaning by itself, so below we present two methods to help overcome this problem.

The first method, is to make use of baselines for model comparison, which are models or values that can be utilised to provide a reference for a loss, they provide a universal method to judge all models of the same class by [@Gressmann2018].
In classification, it is possible to derive analytical baseline values, for example a Brier score is considered 'good' if it is below 0.25 or a log loss if it is below 0.693 (@fig-eval-brierlog), this is because these are the values obtained if you always predicted probabilties as $0.5$, which is a reasonable basline guess in a binary classificaiton problem.
In survival analysis, simple analytical expressions are not possible as losses are dependent on the unknown distributions of both the survival and censoring time.
Therefore all experiments in survival analysis must include a baseline model that can produce a reference value in order to derive meaningful results.
A suitable baseline model is the Kaplan-Meier estimator [@Graf1995; @Lawless2010; @Royston2013], which is the simplest model that can consistently estimate the true survival function.

As well as directly comparing losses from a 'sophisticated' model to a baseline, one can also compute the percentage increase in performance between the sophisicated and baseline models, which produces a measure of explained residual variation (ERV) [@Korn1990; @Korn1991].
For any survival loss $L$, the ERV is,

$$
R_L(S, B) = 1 - \frac{L_{|S}}{L_{|B}}
$$

where $L_{|S}$ and $L_{|B}$ is the loss computed with respect to predictions from the sophisticated and baseline models respectively.

The ERV interpretation makes reporting of scoring rules easier within and between experiments.
For example, say in experiment A we have $L_{|S} = 0.004$ and $L_{|B} = 0.006$, and in experiment B we have $L_{|S} = 4$ and $L_{|B} = 6$.
The sophisticated model may appear worse at first glance in experiment A (as the losses are very close) but when considering the ERV we see that the performance increase is identical (both $R_L = 33\%$), thus providing a clearer way to compare models.

## Conclusion

:::: {.callout-warning icon=false}

## Key takeaways

* Scoring rules are a useful tool for measuring a model's overall predictive ability, taking into account calibration and discrimination.
* Strictly proper scoring rules allow models to be compared to one another, which is important when choosing models in a benchmark experiment.
* Many scoring rules for censored data are *not* strictly proper, however experiments suggest that improper rules still provide useful and trustworthy results [@Sonabend2022b]

:::: {.callout-important icon=false}

## Limitations

* Scoring rules can be difficult to interpret but ERV representations can be a helpful way to overcome this.
* There is no consensus about which scoring rule to use and when so in practice multiple scoring rules may have to be reported in experiments to ensure transparency and fairness of results.
* For non- and semi-parametric survival models that return distribution predictions, estimates of $f(t)$ are not readily available and require approximations [@Rindt2022], hence logarithmic losses such as RCLL can often not be directly used in practice.
