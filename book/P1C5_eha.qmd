# Event-history Analysis {#sec-eha}

{{< include _wip.qmd >}}

___

In this chapter we take a more general view on time-to-event data.
So far, we only considered a single potentially censored, outcome of interest.
Here we explore more complex settings with multiple, potentially mutually exclusive events and recurrences of events.
In this generalisation, the observed data is sometimes referred to as *event-history data* and its analysis as *event-history analysis* (EHA).

One way to think about event history data is in terms of transitions between different states, as illustrated in @fig-eha.
Usually, a subject starts out in state 0 (for example, 'healthy') and transitions to different states from there.
States from which further transitions are possible are called *transient*, otherwise a state is called *terminal* or *absorbing*.

In the *single event* setting (@fig-eha, upper left panel), a subject can only transition to one state (the event of interest).
This setting was the focus of @sec-surv.
There, the censoring event was considered independent of the event of interest.
In the *competing risks* setting (@fig-eha, upper right panel, @sec-competing-risks), a subject could transition to any of the $q$ mutually exclusive states, thus the subject is initially *at risk* for a transition to multiple states.
However, once one of them occurs, the process is considered to have concluded (for the modeling purposes).
In both cases, the event needs not be terminal (in the sense of death), we just end the observation/modeling after the first occurrence of an event.

In the most general case, the *multi-state* setting (@fig-eha lower right panel, @sec-multi-state), there are multiple transient and terminal states with potential back transitions (for example, moving between different stages of an illness with the possibility of (partial) recovery and death as terminal event).

In the *recurrent events setting* (@fig-eha lower left panel), the same event can be observed multiple times on the same subject (for example recurrent respiratory infections during one year).
The bottom left panel of @fig-eha shows two different ways to represent recurrent events, (a) reset the status to $0$ after occurrence of an event or (b) consider the $1$st, $2$nd, etc. recurrences of the event as separate states.
In some data sets only the recurrence of the event of interest is present.
Often, however, recurrent event processes also have a potential competing, terminal event, indicated by light grey, dotted arrows.
In the previous example, subjects may die from one of the recurrences of infection.
In the more complex cases, recurrent events are treated as a multi-state process and modeled accordingly, therefore we don't treat recurrent events separately in this book, but excellent accounts are given in @cookStatisticalAnalysisRecurrent2007 and @erdmann2024comparisonnonparametrica.

## Competing Risks {#sec-competing-risks}

In contrast to single-event survival analysis, competing risks are concerned with the time to the first of multiple, mutually exclusive events.
Mutually exclusive here means that once one of the events occurs, we can not observe the others (at the same time).
As in the single event case, the events may not necessarily be terminal (such as death), instead they just signify the end of the observation period of interest.
In contrast to the single event case, even if only one of the outcomes is of interest, the others can not be treated as independent censoring events.

@tbl-surv-data-sir.adm. shows an excerpt of the `sir.adm` data [@pkgmvna] of patients on the ICU.
Time under observation (`time`) could end in one of three outcomes: 0 (right-censoring at the end of the study), 1 (discharge alive), or 2 (death on ICU).
The interest was in how pneumonia status at admission to the ICU (`pneumonia`) affects mortality.

|    `id`| `time`| `status`| `pneumonia`|
|-------:|----:|------:|----:|
|   31561|    8|      0|    no|
|   31205|    8|      0|    no|
| 2002453|   31|      1|    yes|
| 1021616|    5|      1|    no|
| 1014059|    9|      2|    no|
| 1003059|    5|      2|    no|
: Subset of the `sir.adm` dataset [@pkgmvna].
Rows are individual observations (`id`), `time` is time under observation, `status` indicates the outcome observed (0=censored at the end of the study, 1=discharged alive from the ICU, 2: death in the ICU). {#tbl-surv-data-sir.adm}

Here, discharge from the hospital must not be considered independent right-censoring as was the case in the `tumor` data example in @sec-surv-km.
There, patients were followed even after hospital discharge, thus loss to follow-up could be considered truly random and therefore independent of the event of interest.
In this study on the other hand, follow-up stopped once patients were discharged and it is unrealistic to assume that subjects would continue to be exposed to the same risk of dying after discharge compared to subject still in the ICU.
Analysis of this data and how the different assumptions (independent censoring vs. competing risks) affects the estimates is discussed in @sec-aalen-johanson and @sec-cens-vs-cr.

### Notation and Definitions

To introduce the competing risks setting more formally, let $Y$ be the time-to-event as before.
In the competing risks setting, there is now an additional random variable $E\in \{1,\ldots,q\}$ with realisations $e$, which denotes one of $q$ competing events that can occur at event time $Y$.
The survival outcome notation, $(Y, \Delta)$, thus has to be extended to accommodate for the possibility of competing risks.
Previously, we defined the status indicator $\Delta \in \{0,1\}$ for right-censored data.
In the competing risks setting we have $\Delta = I(Y_i \leq C_i) \wedge E_i = e$, such that
$\Delta \in \{0, 1, \ldots, q\}$ where $\Delta = 0$ indicates censoring as before (that is subject remained in state 0 until end of follow up) and $\Delta = e$ means the $e$th event occurred.
Rather then estimating the distribution of event times $P(Y\leq \tau)$, the goal is to estimate the joint distribution of $Y$ and $E$, $P(Y\leq \tau, E=e)$.

A common approach to competing-risks analysis is known as *cause-specific hazards*, where $h_{e}$ is defined as the hazard for the transition from initial state $0$ to state $e$:
<!--  -->
$$
h_{e}(\tau) = \lim_{\triangle \tau \to 0} \frac{P(\tau \leq Y < \tau + \triangle \tau, E = e\ |\ Y \geq \tau)}{\triangle \tau}, \; e \in \{1, \dots, q\}.
$$ {#eq-cause-specific-hazard}
<!--  -->

Analogous to the single-event case, we can also define the cause-specific cumulative hazard
<!--  -->

$$
H_{e}(\tau) = \int_{0}^\tau h_e(u)\ du
$$ {#eq-cause-specific-cumu-hazard}
<!--  -->

As competing events are mutually exclusive at any time $\tau$, it is possible to define the *all-cause hazard* which is the hazard of any event occurring as the sum of all cause-specific hazards
<!--  -->
$$
h(\tau) = \sum_{e = 1}^{q}h_{e}(\tau),
$$ {#eq-all-cause-hazard}
<!--  -->
as well as the *all-cause cumulative hazard*, which can be obtained either via the integral over the all-cause hazard (@eq-all-cause-hazard) or as sum of cause-specific cumulative  hazards (@eq-cause-specific-cumu-hazard):
<!--  -->
$$
H(\tau) = \int_{0}^\tau h(u)\ du = \sum_{e=1}^{q}\int_{0}^\tau h_{e}(u)\ du = \sum_{e=1}^q H_{e}(\tau).
$$ {#eq-all-cause-cumu-hazard}
<!--  -->
The *all-cause survival probability*
<!--  -->
$$
S(\tau) = P(Y > \tau) = \exp(-H(\tau))
$$ {#eq-all-cause-surv-prob}
<!--  -->
gives the probability that *none* of the events occurred before $\tau$.
It is usually not estimated directly but calculated from the cause specific hazards instead via @eq-all-cause-cumu-hazard and @eq-all-cause-surv-prob.

In applications, next to the cause-specific (cumulative) hazards, one is often interested in the *Cumulative Incidence Function* (CIF), which denotes the probability of experiencing an event $e$ before time $\tau$
<!--  -->
$$
F_{e}(\tau) = P(Y \leq \tau, E = e) = \int_{0}^\tau S(u-)h_{e}(u)\ \mathrm{d}u,\ e\in \{1,\ldots,q\},
$$ {#eq-cif}
<!--  -->
where

* $S(u-)$ is the probability of surviving (not experiencing any of the competing events) until the time-point shortly before $u$
* $S(u-)h_{e}(u)$ (@eq-continuous-hazard) is the probability of experiencing event $e$ at time point $u$.

$F_e(\tau)$ can be interpreted as the proportion of subjects who experienced event of type $e$ until time $\tau$.
Because the events are mutually exclusive, it holds that $F(\tau) = P(Y\leq\tau) = \sum_{e=1}^q F_e(\tau) = 1 - S(\tau)$.
As all terms of @eq-cif can be calculated from the cause-specific hazards (@eq-cause-specific-hazard), their estimation fully determines the joint distribution of $Y$ and $E$.

### Aalen-Johanson estimator for the cumulative incidence {#sec-aalen-johanson}

As for the single-event case (@sec-surv-estimation-non-param), one can define a simple non-parametric estimator for the cause-specific cumulative hazard (@eq-cause-specific-cumu-hazard) based on a generalization of the Nelson-Aalen estimator (@eq-nelson-aalen) and the Aalen-Johanson estimator (@aalenEmpiricalTransitionMatrix1978) for the CIF (@eq-cif).

Recall from from @sec-data-rc the definitions of the unique ordered event times $t_{(k)}, k=1\ldots,m$, risk-set at time $t_{(k)}$, $\calR_{t_{(k)}}$, number of events, $d_{t_{(k)}}$, and number at risk $n_{t_{(k)}}$.
Assume partitioning of the follow-up into $m$ disjunct intervals $(t_{(k-1)}, t_{(k)}],k=1,\ldots,m$, such that $Y\in (t_{(k-1)}, t_{(k)}] \Leftrightarrow \tilde{Y}=t_{(k)}$.

The *cause-specific* discrete time hazard (@eq-discrete-hazard) is defined by changing the numerator $d_{t_{(k)}}$ to $d_{e,t_{(k)}}$ (the number of events of type $e$ at time $t_{(k)}$):
<!--  -->
$$
h^d_{e}(t_{(k)}) := \frac{d_{e,t_{(k)}}}{n_{t_{(k)}}},\ e \in \{1, \ldots, q\}.
$$ {#eq-cs-discrete-hazard}
<!--  -->
The Nelson-Aalen estimator (@eq-nelson-aalen) for the *cause-specific* cumulative hazard is then given by
<!--  -->
$$
H_{NA,e}(\tau) = \sum_{k:t_{(k)}\leq\tau} h^d_{e}(t_{(k)}) = \sum_{k:t_{(k)} \leq \tau} \frac{d_{e,t_{(k)}}}{n_{t_{(k)}}},
$$ {#eq-cs-nelson-aalen}
<!--  -->
which yields a step function for each $e$, with jumps at time points $t_{(k)}$.


The all-cause survival probability follows from @eq-all-cause-cumu-hazard and @eq-all-cause-surv-prob as
<!--  -->
$$
S_{NA}(\tau) = \exp\left(-\sum_{e=1}^q H_{NA,e}(\tau)\right).
$$
<!--  -->
Finally, the Aalen-Johanson (AJ) estimator for the CIF follows via @eq-discrete-prob as
<!--  -->
$$
F_{AJ,e}(\tau) = \sum_{k:t_{(k)}\leq \tau} S_{NA}(\tau-)h^d_e(\tau)=  \sum_{k:t_{(k)}\leq \tau} S_{NA}(t_{(k-1)})\frac{d_{e,t_{(k)}}}{n_{t_{(k)}}}
$$ {#eq-aalen-johanson}
<!--  -->


For illustration of the AJ estimator and the interpretation of the CIFs consider the analysis conducted in @beyersmann.competing.2012, based on the data from @tbl-surv-data-sir.adm.
Recall that one is interested in estimation of the mortality conditional on pneumonia status at admission, while accounting for discharge from the ICU as competing risk ($E \in \{\text{"discharge"}, \text{"death"}\}$).
While the AJ estimator cannot naturally incorporate covariate information, it can be applied to subgroups of the data (here based on the pneumonia status).
Note that this will yield different sets of unique event times in each group, thus the AJ can have jumps at different time-points for the two groups.

@fig-cif-sir shows the AJ estimates of the CIFs for each event (discharge/death) separately for patients with and without pneumonia.
Exemplary, the proportion of subjects with pneumonia being discharged until $\tau=120\text{ days}$ is approximately 75% ($\hat{F}_{\text{discharge}}(120) = P(Y\leq 120, E=\text{"discharge"})\approx 0.75$), while approximately 25% died in the ICU ($\hat{F}_{\text{death}}(120) = P(Y\leq 120, E=\text{"death"})\approx 0.25)$.
For patients without pneumonia we have $\hat{F}_{\text{discharge}}(120) \approx 0.91$ and $\hat{F}_{\text{death}} \approx 0.09$.
In this example, $\hat{F}_{\text{discharge}} + \hat{F}_{\text{death}} \approx 1$ for both pneumonia groups, as only 14 of 747 patients were censored (neither discharge nor death) at the end of the follow-up.

![Aalen-Johanson estimator for the `sir.adm` data [@pkgmvna], stratified by pneumonia status at admission to the ICU. Left panel: Proportion of subjects discharged alive from the ICU. Right panel: Proportion of subjects who died in the ICU.](Figures/survival/cif-sir.png){#fig-cif-sir fig-alt="Illustration of the Aalen-Johanson estimator for the cumulative incidence function, stratified by pneumonia status at admission to the ICU."}



### Independent Censoring vs. Competing Risks {#sec-cens-vs-cr}

It is worth spending some time to consider the difference between independent right-censoring and competing risks.
Note that for the estimation of the hazard @eq-cs-discrete-hazard, occurrences of competing events are implicitly assumed right-censored (as $d_{e,t_{(k)}})$ only counts events of type $e$ and $n_{t_{(k)}}$ contains the same subjects that would remain if events of type $\tilde{e}\neq e$ were considered censored before $t_{(k)}$.
Nevertheless, competing risks are taken into account in the definition of the AJ estimator (@eq-aalen-johanson), as the all-cause survival probability (@eq-all-cause-surv-prob) depends on all cause-specific hazards.

In contrast, assume that in our analysis of the `sir.adm` data we would consider time of discharge as independent right-censoring.
As we only have one other event (death), the data could be treated as single-event, right-censored data as in @sec-surv and therefore analysed using the Nelson-Aalen estimator (@eq-nelson-aalen, @eq-surv-na).
The probability of death before some time-point $\tau$ could thus be obtained via $P(Y\leq \tau) = F(\tau) = 1 - S_{NA}(\tau)$.


@fig-cens-vs-cr shows the estimates obtained under the two assumptions.
Solid lines are identical to the right-hand side of @fig-cif-sir and indicate the probabilities under the competing risks assumption.
Dashed lines are obtained under the independent right-censoring assumption.
Clearly, the probabilities of dying at time $\tau=120$ are overestimated when independent censoring is assumed ($\approx$ 75% vs. $\approx$ 25% in the pneumonia group and $\approx$ 62% vs. $\approx$ 13% in the no pneumonia group).

## Multi-state Models {#sec-multi-state}

The multi-state process can be considered the most general type of time-to-event process, as other types (single-event, competing risks, recurrent events) can be viewed as special cases.
Multi-state modeling allows realistic depiction of complex processes where subjects can start in different states and transition back and forth between them.

@fig-multi-state depicts two exemplary multi-state settings.
The left panel depicts a process without back-transitions. Subjects can transition from the initial state 0 to final state 2 either directly ($0 \rightarrow 2$) or via intermediate (transient) state 1 ($0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$).
This specific setting is sometimes referred to as "illness-death model" in medical contexts, as healthy subjects (state 0) can transition to death (state 2) either directly or after prior illness (state 1).
The right panel depicts a more complex process where subjects can transition from initial state 0 to final stage 3 either directly ($0 \rightarrow 3$) or via intermediate states 1 and 2 ($0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$ or $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$).
Note, however, that here back transitions are possible, thus for any subject, transition histories like $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 3$ or  $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0$ and many others are possible.
Remaining in the current state is also possible.
Additionally, in the multi-state setting, subjects could start from different transient states in the beginning of the study as discussed further below.

![Left: The illness-death model where subjects can transition from states: healthy (0), with illness (1), and terminal state death (2) without back-transitions. Right: Illustration of a more general multi-state model with back-transitions. Here subjects can transition from state healthy (0) to different disease progressions (1, 2) with (potential) recovery and terminal state death (3).](Figures/survival/multi-state-examples-w-transitions.png){#fig-multi-state fig-alt="Schematic illustration of different multi-state models."}

@tbl-ms-data-prothr shows a subset of the `prothr` dataset [@pkgmstate] of liver cirrhosis patients from a randomized clinical trial, where some patients where treated with prednisone and others received a placebo.
At the beginning of the trial some of the patients have normal prothrombin levels (state 0) while others have abnormal prothrombin levels (state 1), which can be viewed as a form of disease progression. Death (state 3) constitutes an absorbing state.
The goal of the trial was to investigate if treatment (prednisone) slows down or reverses disease progression (transitions $0 \rightarrow 1$ and $1 \rightarrow 0$) and reduces mortality (transitions $0 \rightarrow 2$ and $1 \rightarrow 2$).
The data set thus constitutes an example of an illness-death model (left panel of @fig-multi-state), however with possible back-transition from abnormal to normal prothrombin levels.
The data set contains one row for each transition for which a patient (`id`) was at risk for.
The columns `from` and `to` indicate the initial state (at time `tstart`) and end state (at the end of observation in this state `tstop`).
Variable `status` indicates whether the transition was actually made (`status = 1`) or not (`status = 0`).
Finally, `treatment` indicates whether a patient was assigned the treatment or placebo group.

Concretely, in @tbl-ms-data-prothr, subject `id=1` already had abnormal prothrombin levels at the beginning of the trial, thus started in state 1 with possible transitions $1\rightarrow 0$ and $1 \rightarrow 2$.
In this case, the patient died, thus the transition $1\rightarrow 2$ realised after 151 days, while the transition $1 \rightarrow 0$ is a 'counterfactual' transition that could have happened, but didn't.
Patient `id=8` also started in state 1, but made a back transition to normal prothrombin levels after 211 days at which time they entered the risk set for transitions $0\rightarrow 1$ and $0\rightarrow 2$, neither of which realised.
Thus the subject was censored in state 0 after 2770 days.
Finally, subject `id=46` started in state 0 (normal prothrombin levels), transitioned to state 1 (abnormal levels) after 415 days and then died (transition $1\rightarrow 2$) two days later.
This also illustrates the importance of left-truncation (@sec-truncation) in multi-state processes. For example, subjects `id=1` and `id=8` are at risk for the transitions $1 \rightarrow 0$ and $1 \rightarrow 2$ from the beginning of the trial (`tstart = 0`).
Subject `id=46` on the other hand starts in state 0 and only enters state 1 (and thus the risk set for the transitions $1\rightarrow 0$ and $1\rightarrow 2$) after 415 days (`tstart = 415`).
Other subjects in the data may never enter the risk set for these transitions by remaining in state 0 until the end of follow up or by directly transitioning to state 2.
The fact that subjects enter the risk sets for different transitions at different time points technically constitutes left-truncation and thus should be taken into account accordingly (@sec-ms-aalen-johanson).

### Notation and Definitions

Similar to competing risks (@sec-competing-risks), transitions between different states (see @fig-multi-state) are characterized by transition-specific hazards, denoted by $h_{\ell\rightarrow e}(\tau)$ or short $h_{\ell e}(\tau)$, where $\ell \in \mathcal{L}$ is the starting state and $e \in \mathcal{E}$ the end state, with $\mathcal{L}$ the set of possible starting states (transient states) and $\mathcal{E}$ the set of possible end states (transient and terminal states).
Technically $e$ should depend on $\ell$, $e(\ell)$, as not all endpoints can be reached from a given starting state.
For example, in the right panel of @fig-multi-state $\ell \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ and $e(0) \in \{1, 3\}$, $e(1) \in \{0, 2, 3\}$ and $e(2) = \{1, 3\}$.
However, for notational convenience the difference between $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ as well as the dependency of $e$ on $\ell$ is often ignored  and we simply write $\ell, e \in \mathcal{E}$, where $\mathcal{E}= \{0,\ldots, q\}$ includes all possible states.

To formalise the multi-state setting further, let $E(\tau)\in \{0,\ldots,q\}$ the state occupied at time $\tau$.
Then, the transition specific hazard can be defined as
<!--  -->
$$
\begin{aligned}
h_{\ell e}(\tau) &=  \lim_{\triangle \tau \to 0} \frac{P(\tau \leq Y < \tau + \triangle\tau, E(\tau + \triangle\tau)=e|Y \geq \tau, E(\tau-) = \ell)}{\triangle \tau}&\nonumber\\
                 &         &\ e \neq \ell.\\
                 & =: \lim_{\triangle \tau \to 0} \frac{P(E(\tau + \triangle\tau)=e|E(\tau-) = \ell)}{\triangle \tau}&\nonumber
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-ms-transition-hazards}

Transition hazards @eq-ms-transition-hazards indicate the relative risk to enter state $e$ at time $\tau$ given occupation of state $\ell$ in the instant before $\tau$ ($\tau-$).

Analogous to the competing risks setting, we can define the transition specific cumulative hazards

$$
H_{\ell e}(\tau) = \int_{0}^{\tau}h_{\ell e}(u)du
$$ {#eq-ms-cumu-hazard}


As in the competing risks setting, however, (cumulative) transition hazards don't tell the full story when absolute probabilities of transition are of interest.
The probability to transition from state $\ell$ to $e$ between two time-points depends on all transitions possible from $\ell$ and potentially the transitions that have taken place in the past.
Thus, other quantities of interest in the multi-state setting are the transition probabilities $P_{\ell e}(\zeta, \tau):= P(E(\tau) = e|E(\zeta) = \ell)$, that is the probability to transition from state $\ell$ to state $e$ between time points $\zeta < \tau$.
Implicitly, the above notation assumes that the process is Markovian, that is the probability only depends on the knowledge of the current state at time $\zeta$, not additional past of the process (although extensions that relax this assumption exist).
Transition probabilities of a multi-state process are often summarized in a quadratic matrix of transition probabilities
<!--  -->
$$
\mathbf{P}(\zeta, \tau):=
\begin{pmatrix}
  P_{00}(\zeta, \tau) & \cdots & P_{0q}(\zeta, \tau)\\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
  P_{q0}(\zeta, \tau) & \cdots & P_{qq}(\zeta, \tau)\\
\end{pmatrix},
$$ {#eq-ms-trans-prob-mat}
<!--  -->
where rows indicate starting states and columns indicate end states.
Some of the elements of $\mathbf{P}$ might be zero or one depending on the specific process, presence of absorbing states and possible pathways between states.
As subjects can only be in one of the $q+1$ states at $\tau$, rows have to sum up to 1:
<!--  -->
$$
\sum_{e =0}^q P_{\ell e} = 1,\forall \ell \in \{0, \ldots,q\}.
$$ {#eq-ms-trans-prob-row-sums}
<!--  -->

For illustration, consider the illness-death model (left panel of @fig-multi-state).
In this example, back-transitions are not possible, therefore the lower triangle of the matrix is filled with zeros and $P_{22}(\zeta, \tau)\equiv 1, \forall\ \zeta < \tau$ by virtue of being an absorbing state. The transition matrix is thus given as
<!--  -->
$$
\mathbf{P}(\zeta, \tau) =
  \begin{pmatrix}
  P_{00}(\zeta, \tau) & P_{01}(\zeta, \tau) & P_{02}(\zeta, \tau)\\
  0 & P_{11}(\zeta, \tau) & P_{12}(\zeta, \tau)\\
  0 & 0 & 1\\
  \end{pmatrix}
$$ {#eq-ms-trans-prob-mat-illness-death}
<!--  -->
So far, this is not very useful for estimation.
Thus, for now, assume that data is collected in discrete time, that is $\zeta, \tau \in \{0, 1, 2,\ldots\}, \zeta < \tau$ and transitions only occur at these discrete time points and not in between.
Say we are interested in transition probability $P_{02}(4, 6)$, that is the probability to transition from state $0$ to state $2$ between time points $\zeta=4$ and $\tau=6$, given we are in state $0$ at time $\zeta = 4$.

This is possible in three ways:

- stay in state $0$ at time $5$, transition to state $2$ at time $6$,
transition to state $1$ at time $5$, transition to state $2$ at time $6$, or
- transition to state $2$ directly at time $5$.

Thus, $P_{02}(4,6) = p_{00}(5)p_{02}(6) + p_{01}(6)p_{12}(6) + p_{02}(5)$, where $p_{\ell e}(\tau)=P(E(\tau)=e|E(\tau -1) = \ell)$ are the probabilities for transitions $\ell \rightarrow e$ between two discrete time points.
Thus, in discrete time, the matrix of transition probabilities can be represented as a finite matrix product (not element wise product)

$$
\mathbf{P}(\zeta, \tau) = \prod_{j =\zeta+1}^{\tau}
\begin{pmatrix}
  p_{00}(j) & p_{01}(j) & p_{02}(j)\\
  0 & p_{11}(j) & p_{12}(j)\\
  0 & 0 & 1\\

where the quantity of interest, $P_{02}(4, 6)$ is given in the top right corner, but other transition probabilities are also readily available. For example, the probability to transition from state $1$ to $2$ between time points $\zeta=4$ and $\tau=6$ is given as $P_{12}(4, 6) = p_{11}(5)p_{12}(6) + p_{12}(5)$.

Returning to the continuous time setting where transitions can occur at any time point, ideas from the discrete time setting still hold.
Imagine dividing the interval $(\zeta, \tau]$ into $J$ intervals such that $\zeta = t_{0} < t_{1} < \cdots < t_{j} < \cdots t_{J} = \tau$, assuming that no events occur between time points $t_{j} \in \mathbb{R}_+, j=1,\ldots, J$.
Then @eq-ms-trans-prob-ill-death-discrete still holds when replacing $p_{\ell e}(j)$ with $p_{\ell e}(t_j)$.
Increasing the number of intervals to infinity or equivalently, reducing the interval size to infinitesimally small intervals $du$ where only one transition can be observed, leads to a product integral of instantaneous transition probabilities $p_{\ell e}(u) = P(E(u+du) = e|E(u-)=\ell)$, such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P}(\zeta, \tau) & = \Prodi_{u \in (\zeta, \tau]}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{00}(u) & \cdots & p_{0q}(u)\\
    \vdots                  & \ddots & \vdots\\
    p_{q0}(u)  & \cdots & p_{qq}(u)\\
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-ms-prodint}
<!--  -->

Finally, for practical purposes, we express the instantaneous transition probabilities $p_{\ell e}(u)$ in terms of increments of the cumulative hazard using, somewhat informally, the following relationships

- by setting $\triangle \tau$ to some fixed, infinitesimally small value in @eq-ms-transition-hazards, we can write $h_{\ell e}(\tau)\triangle\tau = P\big(E(\tau + \triangle \tau) = e|E(\tau-)=\ell\big)$,
- from @eq-ms-cumu-hazard we get the increments of the cumulative hazard $dH_{\ell e}(u) = h_{\ell e}(u)d u =P\big(E(u+du)=e|E(u-) = \ell\big)\equiv p_{\ell e}(u)$,
- because of relationship @eq-ms-trans-prob-row-sums, diagonal elements are set to $dH_{\ell \ell}(u) := -\sum_{e \neq \ell} dH_{\ell e}(u)$ such that $1 + dH_{\ell\ell}(u) = 1-\sum_{e \neq \ell} dH_{\ell e}(u) = 1 - \sum_{e\neq \ell}p_{\ell e}(u) = p_{\ell\ell}(u)$.


Consequently, @eq-ms-prodint can be rewritten as
<!--  -->
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P}(\zeta, \tau)
                        &= \Prodi_{u \in (\zeta, \tau]}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{00}(u) = :1 + dH_{00}(u) & \cdots & p_{0q}(u) = :dH_{0q}(u)\\
    \vdots                  & \ddots & \vdots\\
    p_{q0}(u) = : dH_{q0}(u)     & \cdots & p_{qq}(u) = :1 + dH_{qq}(u)\\
  \end{pmatrix}\nonumber\\
  & \ \\
  & =  \Prodi_{u \in (\zeta,\tau]}(\mathbf{I} + d\mathbf{H}(u)),\nonumber\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-ms-prodint-cumu-hazards}
<!--  -->
where $\mathbf{I}$ is a $(q+1) \times (q+1)$ identity matrix and $d\mathbf{H}(u)$ is the matrix of increments of the cumulative hazard within infinitesimally small intervals.
Thus, similar to the competing risks setting, relationship @eq-ms-prodint implies that knowledge of the transition specific (cumulative) hazards is sufficient to fully specify the multi-state process.

As analytical solutions of @eq-ms-prodint only exist for specific models, in practice, the transition probabilities are often once again approximated numerically via a finite matrix product on a discrete time grid $\zeta = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_{J-1} < t_{J} = \tau$

$$
\mathbf{P}(\zeta, \tau) \approx \prod_{j=1}^{J}(\mathbf{I} + \Delta\mathbf{H}_{\ell e}(t_{j})),
$$ {#eq-ms-prodint-approx}
<!--  -->
where $\triangle H_{\ell e}(t_{j}) = H_{\ell e}(t_{j}) - H_{\ell e}(t_{j-1})$ is the increment of the cumulative hazards between to consecutive time points.


### Aalen-Johanson Estimator for Transition Probabilities {#sec-ms-aalen-johanson}

Per @eq-ms-prodint-approx all we need for estimation of transition probabilities is an estimate of the transition specific cumulative hazards $H_{\ell e}(\tau)$.
Luckily, similar consideration as for competing risks in @sec-aalen-johanson apply, replacing the cause-specific hazards (@eq-cs-discrete-hazard) with transition-specific hazards
<!--  -->
$$
h^{d}_{\ell e}(t_{(k)}):= \frac{d_{\ell e,t_{(k)}}}{n_{\ell; t_{(k)}}},
$$
<!--  -->
where

- $d_{\ell e,t_{(k)}}$ is now the number of observations with transition $\ell \rightarrow e$ at time $t_{(k)}$ and
- $n_{\ell; t_{(k)}} = |\mathcal{R}_{\ell;t_{(k)}}|$ is the number of subjects in state $\ell$ at time $t_{(k)}$.

Thus, risk set $\mathcal{R}_{\ell;t_{(k)}}$ excludes subjects who entered a terminal state or were censored before time $t_{(k)}$, but also subjects who are not in state $\ell$ at that time (either because they did not reach it yet or transition to another state occurred beforehand).

The cumulative transition-specific hazards thereby follow as
<!--  -->
$$
H_{NA,\ell e}(\tau) = \sum_{k:t_{(k)}\leq \tau} h^d_{\ell e}(t_{(k)}) = \sum_{k:t_{(k)}\leq \tau}\frac{d_{\ell e,t_{(k)}}}{n_{\ell; t_{(k)}}},
$$
<!--  -->

and transition probabilities are obtained via @eq-ms-prodint-approx as
<!--  -->
$$
\hat{\mathbf{P}}(\zeta, \tau) \approx \prod_{j=1}^{J}(\mathbf{I} + \Delta\hat{\mathbf{H}}_{NA,\ell e}(t_{(j)})),
$$ {#eq-ms-aj-trans-prob}

For illustration, consider again the `prothr` data set (@tbl-ms-data-prothr), with possible transitions summarized in @fig-multi-state-prothr-states.
In contrast to the illness-death model in @fig-multi-state, back transitions are possible and some subjects already start in the "abnormal" state at the beginning of the study.

![Transition graph for the liver cirrhosis patients.](Figures/survival/multi-state-prothr-states.png){#fig-multi-state-prothr-states fig-alt="Transition probabilities for the prothrombin data example."}


Figure @fig-multi-state-prothr shows the transition probabilities for the four possible transitions over time for subjects who received treatment and placebo, respectively.
In this example back-transitions are possible, therefore, in contrast to the cumulative incidence functions in the competing risks setting, transition probabilities (to transient states) are not monotonously increasing over time.
While the probabilities to transition from normal or abnormal state to death ($0 \rightarrow 2$, $1 \rightarrow 2$)  increase over time for both groups, probabilities for transitions between the transient states (normal to abnormal and vice versa) increase in the beginning but eventually decreases over time. Overall, prednisone doesn't appear to have a strong protective effect.
Although there appears to be a reduction in $0 \rightarrow 2$ transitions  and an increase in $1\rightarrow 0$ transitions  between time points $1000$ and $3000$, this effect doesn't seem to persist until the end of the follow up.
