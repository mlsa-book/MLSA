# Traditional Survival Models {#sec-models-classical}

{{< include _wip_minor.qmd >}}

Defining if a model is 'machine learning' is surprisingly difficult, with terms such as 'iterative' and 'loss optimization' being frequently used in often clunky definitions.
This book defines machine learning models as those that:

1. Require intensive model fitting procedures such as recursion or iteration;
2. Are flexible with hyper-parameters that can be tuned;
3. Trained using some form of loss optimization;
4. Are 'black boxes' without simple closed-form expressions that can be easily interpreted;
5. Aim to minimize the difference between predictions and truth whilst placing minimal assumptions on the underlying data form.

In contrast, 'traditional' models, refer here to low-complexity models that are either non-parametric or have a simple closed-form expression with parameters that can be fit with maximum likelihood estimation (or an analogous method).
Further, these traditional models are assumed to be fast to fit and highly interpretable, though can be inflexible and may make unreasonable assumptions as they assume underlying probability distributions to model data.

Whilst this book is focused on machine learning, there are a few reasons to include a chapter on lower-complexity models.

Firstly, it can be difficult to determine if a model is 'machine learning', as low-complexity models can be augmented with machine learning methods to create a model that could be termed as 'machine learning' (@sec-classical-improving).
In fact, several papers have demonstrated that augmenting traditional models in this way can yield models that outperform machine learning alternatives even on high-dimensional data (when the number of variables far exceeds the number of rows) [@Zhang2021; @Spooner2020].
Secondly, the majority of machine learning survival algorithms make use of traditional models, often using non-parametric estimators (@sec-classical-nonpar) and/or assuming a proportional hazards form (@sec-classical-cox), as a central component to construct an algorithm around.
Finally, on lower dimensional data, traditional methods often outperform machine learning models even without further adjustment [@Beaulac2020; @Burk2024].

Therefore, a robust understanding of these models is imperative to fairly construct and evaluate machine learning survival models.
This chapter begins with a recap of estimators seen in the first part of this book and demonstrating how they can be used as predictive models, with further estimators then introduced.
Semi- and fully-parametric models are then introduced, most notably the Cox proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time models.
Finally, methods to improve traditional models through machine learning methodology is presented.

## Non-Parametric Estimators {#sec-classical-nonpar}

The Kaplan-Meier estimator [@Kaplan1958] was introduced in @sec-surv-km as the step-function

$$
\KMS(\tau) = \prod_{k:t_{(k)} \leq \tau}\left(1-\frac{d_{t_{(k)}}}{n_{t_{(k)}}}\right)
$$ {#eq-km-ml}

where $t_{(k)}$ are ordered event times, $d_{t_{(k)}}$ and $n_{t_{(k)}}$ are the number of events and observations at risk at $t_{(k)}$ respectively.
In @sec-surv-km, this was discussed as an estimator for visualizing survival distributions and for descriptive analysis.
However, now consider how this estimator could be used as a simple predictive method.
As an unconditional non-parametric method, the estimator assumes no distribution for survival times and ignores any covariate data.
Say we are given the following dataset of survival outcomes:

|litter |rx |sex |time |status |
|:------|:--|:---|:----|:------|
|6      |0  |m   |62   |0      |
|57     |0  |f   |55   |1      |
|60     |1  |m   |104  |0      |
|85     |1  |f   |92   |1      |
|97     |0  |f   |91   |0      |

: Sample of the $\code{rats}$ dataset from $\Rstats$ package $\pkg{survival}$. {#tbl-rats}

@tbl-rats-km below demonstrates construction of the Kaplan-Meier estimator at each possible time-point, where the second column is the contribution to the estimator at the given time:

| $\tau$ | $1 - d/n$ | $\KMS(\tau)$ |
|------| --- | -- |
| 55 | 0.8 | 0.8 |
| 62 | 1 | 0.8 |
| 91 | 1 | 0.8 |
| 92 | 0.5 | 0.4 |
| 104 | 1 | 0.4 |

: Kaplan-Meier contributions (second column) and estimation (third column) at each time $\tau$ based on the data from @tbl-rats. {#tbl-rats-km}

Now if @tbl-rats is taken to be training data, then the values in @tbl-rats-km can be used to predict the probability of survival at a given time.
For example, without needing to know any other information about a new rat that enters the data (for these estimators ignore covariates), there is an $80\%$ chance of survival until $\tau = 60$, which drops to $40\%$ after 92 days.

Estimating the Kaplan-Meier on training data and using those values for predictions of new data, yields a 'baseline' model that can be compared to more sophisticated alternatives to improve interpretability in model evaluation (@sec-eval-distr-score-base).
In this book, $\KMS$ specifically refers to the Kaplan-Meier estimator fit on some training data.
Similarly, $\KMG$ specifically refers to the Kaplan-Meier estimator fit on the observed censoring times $(t_i, 1-\delta_i)$ from some training data.

The Nelson-Aalen estimator [@Aalen1978; @Nelson1972], introduced in @sec-surv-estimation-non-param, can also be used as a baseline predictive model.

$$
\hatH_{NA}(\tau) = \sum_{t_{(k)}\leq \tau} \frac{d_{t_{(k)}}}{n_{t_{(k)}}}.
$$

The Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators are consistent estimators for the survival and cumulative hazard functions respectively; the former is more widely utilized as a baseline estimator [@Herrmann2020; @Huang2020; @Wang2017].
As well as supporting in interpretability, both methods can be used for graphical calibration of models (@sec-calib-km), components of complex models (@sec-car), and other diagnostic graphical tools [@Habibi2018; @Jager2008; @Moghimi-dehkordi2008].

Extensions to other censoring and truncation types as well as event history analysis more generally follows from using the estimators defined in @sec-surv-estimation-non-param, @sec-aalen-johanson, and @sec-ms-aalen-johanson.

As well as unconditional estimators, which do not account for covariates, an alternative is the conditional Akritas estimator [@Akritas1994] usually defined by [@Blanche2013]:

$$
\hatS(\tau|\xx^*, \lambda) = \prod_{k:\tbk\leq \tau} \Big(1 - \frac{\sum^n_{i=1} K(\xx^*,\xx_i|\lambda)\II(t_i = \tbk, \delta_i = 1)}{\sum^n_{i=1} K(\xx^*,\xx_i|\lambda)\II(t_i \geq \tbk)}\Big)
$$ {#eq-akritas}

where $K$ is a kernel function, usually $K(x,y|\lambda) = \II(\lvert \hat{F}_X(x) - \hat{F}_X(y)\rvert < \lambda), \lambda \in (0, 1]$, $\hat{F}_X$ is the empirical distribution function of the data, and $\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter.
The estimator can be interpreted as a conditional Kaplan-Meier estimator which is computed on a neighbourhood of subjects closest to $\xx^*$.
In fact, if $\lambda = 1$ then $K(\cdot|\lambda) = 1$ and @eq-akritas is identical to @eq-km-ml.

The formulation in @eq-akritas includes fitting and predicting in one step as the usual application of the model is as a non-parametric estimator.
By first estimating $\hatF_X$ on separate training data, the estimator can be used as a baseline predictive model.

## Proportional Hazards {#sec-classical-cox}

This section begins with an introduction to the proportional hazards concept using the Cox PH model and then moves to fully parametric proportional hazards models, with the Weibull model as a motivating example.

### Semi-Parametric PH

The Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH)  [@Cox1972], or Cox model, is likely the most widely known semi-parametric model and the most studied survival model [@Reid1994; @Wang2017].
Let $\eta_i = \xx_i^\trans\bsbeta$ be the linear predictor for some observation $i$ with covariates $\xx_i$ and model coefficients $\bsbeta \in \Reals^p$, then the Cox model assumes the hazard function for $i$ follows the form:

$$
h_{Cox}(\tau|\xx_i)= h_0(\tau)\exp(\eta_i)
$$ {#eq-cox}

or in equivalent forms:

$$
S_{Cox}(\tau|\xx_i)= S_0(\tau)^{\exp(\eta_i)}
$$ {#eq-cox-surv}

$$
H_{Cox}(\tau|\xx_i)= H_0(\tau)\exp(\eta_i)
$$ {#eq-cox-cum}

Ignoring the $h_0$ term for now, this form encodes the eponymous 'proportional hazards' assumption as the individual's hazard at time $\tau$ is directly proportional to their own covariates: $h(\tau|\xx_i) \propto \exp(\eta_i)$.
In other words, a unit change in a covariate acts multiplicatively on the estimated hazard.
Further, the hazard ratio, which is a measure of the difference in risk, between two different subjects, depends solely on the value of their linear predictors and not on time.
Take the special case of a model with one covariate, $x$, and coefficient, $\beta$, see what happens when $x$ is increased by one unit:

$$
\frac{h_{Cox}(\tau|x+1)}{h_{Cox}(\tau|x)} = \frac{h_0(\tau)\exp((x+1)\beta)}{h_0(\tau)\exp(x\beta)} = \exp(\beta)
$$ {#eq-hazratio}

The difference in risk depends only on $\beta$ and is independent of time, specifically

$$
h_{Cox}(\tau|x+1) = \exp(\beta)h_{Cox}(\tau|x)
$$ {#eq-hazratio-diff}

Estimation of the $\beta$ terms is possible by ignoring $h_0$ as a 'nuissance parameter' and using the 'partial likelihood' function [@Cox1975]:

$$
\calL(\beta) = \prod_{k:\tbk} \Bigg(\frac{\exp(\eta_k)}{\sum_{j \in \calR_{\tbk}} \exp(\eta_j)}\Bigg)
$$ {#eq-partial}

with log-likelihood

$$
\call(\beta) = \sum_{k:\tbk} \Bigg(\eta_k - \log \Big(\sum_{j \in \calR_{\tbk}} \exp(\eta_j)\Big)\Bigg)
$$

where $\calR_\tau := \{i: t_i \geq \tau\}$ is the risk set defined in @sec-data-rc.

Given these formulas, one can make relative risk predictions (@sec-survtsk) as well as analysing patterns in the data by computing hazard ratios, which provide a method for identifying the covariates that have a significant effect on an individual's hazard.
However, to make a full survival distribution prediction, the baseline hazard must be considered.

The baseline hazard, $h_0$, captures the average (baseline) risk for all observations at a given time-point.
The Breslow estimator [@Cox1975] provides a way to obtain an estimate of the cumulative baseline hazard based on the covariate effect estimates obtained from the partial likelihood (@eq-partial):

$$
\hat{H}_{Bres}(\tau) = \sum_{\tbk \leq \tau} \frac{d_{\tbk}}{\sum_{j \in \calR_{\tbk}} \exp(\hat{\eta}_j)}
$$ {#eq-breslow}

where $\hat{\eta}_j$ is the estimated linear predictor for observation $j$.
Note that if the value for all covariates or their effects was zero, or if there were no covariates, then the Breslow estimator is identical to the Nelson-Aalen estimator:

$$
\hat{H}_{Bres}(\tau) = \sum_{\tbk \leq \tau} \frac{d_{\tbk}}{\sum_{j \in \calR_{\tbk}} 1} = \sum_{\tbk \leq \tau} \frac{d_{\tbk}}{n_{\tbk}} = \hat{H}_{NA}(\tau)
$$

With these formulae, the Cox PH can be used as a predictive model by using training data to estimate $\hat{\bsbeta}$ with (@eq-partial).
These fitted coefficients are then used to predict $\hat{\bseta}$ for new observations and finally the cumulative baseline hazard is computed with (@eq-breslow) to return a predicted distribution, for example the survival probability (@eq-surv-cox) via (@eq-surv-cum) and (@eq-surv-haz).

The Cox model is a powerful tool that is constantly being found to outperform machine learning models [@Gensheimer2018; @Luxhoj1997; @VanBelle2011b].
Moreover, it is highly interpretable and as such has a long history of usage in clinical prediction modelling and analysis.
However, the proportional hazards assumption is often violated in real life, leaving the model to be a questionable choice when used for data analysis.
It is possible to extend the model to handle time-varying coefficients and model stratification [@Cox1972], though it is surprisingly difficult to make meaningful and interpretable predictions from a time-varying model [@Reid1994].

In a predictive setting, it also may not matter if the PH assumption is violated, as long as the model is clearly demonstrated to outperform others (with less stringent assumptions) in an empirical benchmark experiment.

### Parametric PH

Semi-parametric approaches (like the Cox model) are popular because they don't make an assumption about the underlying distribution of event times, leaving the baseline hazard unspecified.
However, there are some cases where modelling a particular distribution may make sense.
On these occasions, a particular probability distribution of the event times is assumed, with three common choices [@Kalbfleisch2011; @Wang2017] being the Exponential, Gompertz, and Weibull distributions.
The Weibull distribution is particularly important as it reduces to the Exponential distribution when the shape parameter equals $1$.
Moreover, it is unique (and Exponential as a special case) in that it has both the PH and AFT property (technically a less known representation of Gompertz also has this property).

Assuming a PH model one can plug in the hazard and survival functions from the Weibull distribution into @eq-cox and @eq-cox-surv respectively.
First recall for a $\Weib(\gamma, \lambda)$ distribution with shape parameter $\gamma$ and scale parameter $\lambda$, the relevant functions can be given by [@KalbfleischPrentice1973]:

$$
h(\tau) = \lambda\gamma \tau^{\gamma-1}
$$

and

$$
S(\tau) = \exp(-\lambda \tau^\gamma)
$$

Taking these to be the baseline hazard and survival functions respectively, they can be substituted into the Cox model as follows:

$$
h_{WeibullPH}(\tau|\xx_i)= (\lambda\gamma \tau^{\gamma-1}) \exp(\eta_i)
$$ {#eq-ph-weibull}

or equivalently

$$
S_{WeibullPH}(\tau|\xx_i)= (\exp(-\lambda \tau^\gamma))^{\exp(\eta_i)}
$$

Finally, these formulae can be used to define the full likelihood (@sec-surv-estimation-param) for the WeibullPH model (here for right-censored data):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\calL(\bstheta) &= \prod_{i=1}^n h_Y(t_i|\xx_i, \bstheta)^{\delta_i}S_Y(t_i|\xx_i, \bstheta) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^n \Big((\lambda\gamma t_i^{\gamma-1} \exp(\eta_i))^{\delta_i}\Big)\Big(\exp(-\lambda t_i^\gamma\exp(\eta_i))\Big) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

with log-likelihood

$$
\begin{aligned}
\call(\bstheta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i[\log(\lambda\gamma) + (\gamma-1)\log(t_i) + \eta_i] - \lambda t_i^\gamma\exp(\eta_i) \\
&\propto \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i[\log(\lambda\gamma) + \gamma\log(t_i) + \eta_i] - \lambda t_i^\gamma \exp(\eta_i) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

These likelihoods can be optimized using any suitable method, for example Newton-Raphson or Fisher-Scoring (which require first and second deriviatives) or machine learning approaches like boosting (@sec-boost) and neural networks (@sec-nnet).
Parameters can then be fit using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with respect to all unknown parameters $\bstheta = \{\bsbeta, \gamma, \lambda\}$.
Expansion to other censoring types and truncation follows by using other likelihood forms presented in @sec-surv-estimation.

When considering which probability distributions to model in predictive experiments, Weibull is a common starting choice [@Hielscher2010; @CoxSnell1968; @Rahman2017], its two parameters make it a flexible fit to data but on the other hand it can be easily reduced to Exponential when $\gamma=1$.
Gompertz [@Gompertz1825] is commonly used in medical domains, especially when describing adult lifespans.
In a machine learning context, one can select the optimal distribution for future predictive performance by running a benchmark experiment.
In contrast to the semi-parametric Cox model, fully parametric PH models can predict absolutely continuous survival distributions, they do not treat the baseline hazard as a nuisance, and in general will result in more precise and interpretable predictions if the distribution is correctly specified  [@Reid1994; @Royston2002].

### Competing risks

There are two common methods to extend the Cox model to the competing risks setting.
The first makes use of the cause-specific hazard to fit a cause-specific Cox model, the second fits a 'subdistribution' hazard.

#### Cause-specific PH models {.unlisted .unnumbered}

In the first case, the baseline hazard function and the coefficients are replaced with cause-specific hazard and coefficients:

$$
h_{Cox;e}(\tau|\xx_i)= h_{e;0}(\tau)\exp(\eta_{e;i})
$$ {#eq-cox-cr}

Where $h_{e;0}$ is a cause-specific baseline hazard and $\eta_{e;i}$ is the cause-specific coefficient for observation $i$.

The coefficients are fit by estimating $\hat{\eta}_{e;i}$ with the cause-specific partial likelihood:

$$
\calL(\bsbeta_e) = \prod_{k:\tbke} \Bigg(\frac{\exp(\eta_{e;k})}{\sum_{j \in \calR_{\tbke}} \exp(\eta_{e;j})}\Bigg)
$$ {#eq-partial-cr}

This is identical to the single-event partial likelihood in (@eq-partial), with the only difference being that the product and sum are over the ordered event times for cause $e$.
The risk-set definition is unaltered such that $\calR_{\tbke}$ is the set of observations that have not experienced *any* cause by $\tbke$, which is the $k$th observed event time for cause $e$.
Using the same logic, the Breslow estimator follows from (@eq-breslow) by again taking the sums over $\tbke$ instead of $\tbk$:
$$
\hat{H}_{Bres;e}(\tau) = \sum_{\tbke \leq \tau} \frac{d_{\tbke}}{\sum_{j \in \calR_{\tbke}} \exp(\hat{\eta}_{e;j})}
$$ {#eq-breslow-cr}

Here the baseline hazard is estimated using the Breslow estimator for the Cox semi-parametric cause-specific model.
One could instead assume a parametric form for the baseline hazard and create a fully-parametric cause-specific model, where again the likelihood is calculated for each independent cause separately:

$$
\calL(\bstheta_e) = \prod^n_{i=1} h_e(t_i|\xx_i, \bstheta_e)^{\delta_{i;e}} S_e(t_i|\xx_i, \bstheta_e)
$$

where $\delta_{i;e}$ is the event indicator for cause $e$.
Note that here $S_e(t_i|\xx_i, \bstheta_e) = \exp(H(t_i|\xx_i, \bstheta_e))$ is the survival for event $e$, not the all-cause survival, and thus assumes that other causes are treated as censored.

Any PH distribution (Weibull etc.) can then be substituted into $h_e$ and $S_e$ in the same way as in the single-event case, with distribution parameters being estimated separately for each cause $e$.

#### Subdistribution PH models {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The methods discussed thus far estimate cause-specific hazards (@eq-cause-specific-hazard), which represent the instantaneous risk of an individual experiencing the cause of interest, given that they have not yet experienced *any* event.
An alternative approach is to model subdistribution hazards, which model the risk of an individual experiencing the cause of interest, given they have not yet experienced the event of interest, but may have experienced a competing event.
As will be shown below, the benefit of the subdistribution model is the ability to directly predict the cumulative incidence function (CIF) under a PH model.
In this framework, the subdistribution hazard provides a relationship between covariates and the CIF for an event of interest [@Austin2016].
Mathematically, the difference between cause-specific and subdistribution hazards comes from the definition of the risk set.
As stated above, there is no cause-specific risk set definition.
However, the subdistribution risk set is defined as:

$$
\calR_{e;\tau} := \{i: t_i \geq \tau \vee [e_i \neq e \wedge \delta_i = 1]\}
$$ {#eq-riskset-sd}

Observe that in this definition the left-hand side is the same as the standard risk set definition (@eq-riskset) and the right-hand side additionally includes those that have experienced a different event already.
Anyone that has been censored ($e = e_0$) before $\tau$ is removed from the risk set.

Using this latter definition of the risk set gives rise to the subdistribution hazard function for cause $e$:

$$
h^{SD}_{e}(\tau) = \lim_{\dtau \to 0} \frac{P(\tau \leq Y \leq \tau + \dtau, E = e\ |\ Y \geq \tau \vee (E \neq e \wedge \Delta=1))}{\dtau}
$$ {#eq-hazard-sd}

Subsituting (@eq-hazard-sd) into the baseline hazard of the Cox model (@eq-cox) yields the Fine-Gray subhazard model for the $e$th cause [@Fine1999]:

$$
h_{FG;e}(\tau|\xx_i)= h^{SD}_{e;0}(\tau)\exp(\eta_i) 
$$ {#eq-cox-sd}

This model form assumes that the subdistribution hazards are all proportional.
Estimating the $\beta$ coefficients follows from a weighted, subdistribution adaptation of the partial likelihood (@eq-partial) which depends on the subdistribution risk set definition given in (@eq-riskset-sd).

$$
\calL_e(\beta) = \prod_{k:\tbke} \Bigg(\frac{\exp(\eta_k)}{\sum_{j \in \calR_{e;\tbke}} w_{kj}\exp(\eta_j)}\Bigg)
$$ {#eq-fg-likelihood}

Where $\tbke$ is the ordered event times for observations that experience event $e$.
To account for the updated risk set definition in (@eq-riskset-sd), Fine and Gray defined the weights

$$
w_{kj} := \frac{\KMG(\tbke)}{\KMG(\min\{\tbke, t_j\})}
$$

Where $\KMG$ is the Kaplan-Meier estimator fit on the censoring distribution (@sec-surv-km).
The Fine-Gray model therefore uses inverse probability of censoring weighting (as in many measures @sec-eval-crank-conc) in order to compensate for the effect of competing events.
Because of the way the subdistribution risk set is defined in (@eq-riskset-sd), the denominator of (@eq-fg-likelihood) is a sum over individuals, $j \in \calR_{e;\tbke}$,  at time $\tbke$ who have either yet to experience an event ($t_j \geq \tbke$) or experienced a different event ($t_j < \tbke \wedge e_i \ne e \wedge \delta_i=1$).
The weighting function handles these cases as follows:

1. If $t_j \geq \tbke$ then $w_{kj} = 1$ and thus observations who have not experienced any event contribute the most to the likelihood.
2. If $t_j < \tbke$ then $w_{kj} < 1$ as $\KMG$ is a monotonically decreasing function with $w_{kj}$ continuing to decrease as the distance between $t_j$ and $\tbke$ increases. Thus the contribution from observations that have experienced competing events reduces over time.

Whilst modelling the subdistribution can seem unintuitive note that if there is only one event of interest then $w_{kj} = 1$ for all $k$ and $j$ and further $e_i \neq e$ must always be false, meaning (@eq-riskset-sd) reduces to the standard risk set definition (@eq-riskset) as only the left condition can ever be true and by the same logic the subdistribution hazard reduces to the usual hazard definition.
Therefore the standard Cox PH for single events is perfectly recovered.

Instead of interpreting the subdistribution hazards directly, @Austin2017b recommend interpreting the fitted coefficients via the cause-specific CIF and cumulative hazard forms of (@eq-cox-sd), which can be obtained in the 'usual' way by first integrating to obtain the cumulative hazard form:

$$
H_{FG;e}(\tau|\xx_i)= H^{SD}_{e;0}(\tau)\exp(\eta_i) 
$$ {#eq-fg-cum}

where $H^{SD}_{e;0}$ is the cause-specific baseline cumulative hazard for cause $e$.
Then using (@eq-surv-haz) to relate the survival and hazard functions and representing this in terms of the CIF:

$$
F_{FG;e}(\tau|\xx_i) = 1 - \exp(-H^{SD}_{e;0}(\tau))^{\exp(\eta_i)}
$$ {#eq-fg-cif-long}

Or more simply:

$$
F_{FG;e}(\tau|\xx_i) = 1 - (1 - F^{SD}_{e;0}(\tau))^{\exp(\eta_i)}
$$ {#eq-fg-cif}

where $F^{SD}_{e;0}$ is the cause-specific baseline cumulative incidence function for cause $e$.
The model in (@eq-fg-cif) is fit by estimating the baseline cumulative hazard function and substituting into (@eq-fg-cif-long).
Similarly to how the subdistribution hazard was created, estimation of $\hat{H}^{SD}$ follows by updating (@eq-breslow) to use the subdistribution risk set definition and applying the same weighting to compensate for multiple events: 

$$
\hat{H}^{SD}_{Bres;e}(\tau) = \sum_{\tbke \leq \tau} \frac{d_{\tbke}}{\sum_{j \in \calR_{e;\tbke}} w_{kj}\exp(\hat{\eta}_j)}
$$ {#eq-fg-breslow}

Use of the Fine-Gray model has to be carefully considered before model fitting.
The subdistribution risk set definition, which includes competing events, treats all causes as non-terminal (even if realistically impossible), which means an observation could be considered at risk of the event of interest even after experiencing a competing event.
In practice this is often not the case, especially in medical models where death is often a competing risk.
Moreover, combining subdistribution CIF estimates across causes can result in probabilities that exceed $1$, which should be impossible as events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive [@Austin2022b].
In these above cases, estimating and summing cause-specific hazard functions is preferred [@Austin2022b].
<!-- TODO: REFERENCE SECTION ON SUMMING CAUSE-SPECIFIC HAZARDS -->

The Fine-Gray model is most appropriate when only concerned with a single event of interest and all-cause estimates are not of interest.
Interpreting coefficient changes via (@eq-fg-cif) is slightly more intuitive as making inferences about the magnitude of effects of covariates on the incidence is more standard in clinical settings [@Austin2017b].

## Accelerated Failure Time {#sec-surv-models-param}

Whilst the proportional hazards models is a powerful model, it often does not represent real-world phenomena well.
The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is a popular alternative which models the effect of covariates as 'acceleration factors' that act multiplicatively on time.
In contrast to the PH model, AFT models are all fully-parametric.
A semi-parametric model has been suggested [@Buckley1979] however this is not widely used as it lacks 'theoretical justification' and is 'not reliable' [@Wei1992].
Similarly, whilst its theoretically possible to fit cause-specific AFT models for the competing risks setting, this does not appear common in practice.

### Understanding acceleration

Moving from a PH to AFT framework can be confusing, so to elucidate this, take the following example adapted from @Kleinbaum1996.
Consider the lifespans of humans and small dogs.
In this example we are taking species to be a modifier and we're looking at what survival would look like under AFT (time scaling) versus PH (hazard scaling).

Suppose small dogs age five times faster than humans.
Under AFT (time-scaling modifier), a dog's survival at age $\tau$ matches a human's at $5\tau$:

$$
S_{dog}(\tau) = S_{human}(5\tau)
$$

For example, at age 10, a small dog has the same probability of being alive as a human at age 50.
The dog's survival curve is _accelerated_ by a factor of 5, as shown in the bottom, red curve in @fig-dogs.

If instead, one assumes a constant hazard ratio then at age $\tau$, the dog's risk is five times the humans (@eq-cox-surv):

$$
S_{dog}(\tau) = S_{human}(\tau)^5
$$

the middle, blue curve in @fig-dogs.

These illustrative curves demonstrate how the same modifier yields different behaviour under PH and AFT assumptions.

![Comparing human (black) and dog lifespans where the latter is modelled using an AFT model (red) versus a PH model (blue). Clearly the AFT model is (sadly) a better reflection of reality. Human lifespan modelled with Gompertz(0.09, 0.00005).](Figures/classical/dogs.png){#fig-dogs fig-alt="Survival time is on the x-axis and survival probability on the y-axis. The top, black curve models a human life span smoothly decreasing from S(T)=1 to S(T)=0.5 between T=0 and T=80. The middle, blue curve represents a dog's lifespan under the PH assumption. The survival probability drops close to S(T)=0 by T=0 but is positive and is even above 0.8 at T=30. The bottom, red line represents a dog's lifespan under the AFT assumption. The curve drops to 0 by T=20 but with low survival probability from around T=16."}

More generally, the accelerated failure time model estimates survival functions as

$$
S_{AFT}(\tau|\xx_i) = S_0(\tau e^{-\eta_i})
$$ {#eq-aft-surv}

with respective hazard function

$$
h_{AFT}(\tau|\xx_i) = e^{-\eta_i} h_0(\tau e^{-\eta_i})
$$ {#eq-aft-haz}

Note three key differences compared to the PH model.
Firstly, $\exp(-\eta_i)$ is modelled instead of $\exp(\eta_i)$, hence in a PH model $h_{PH}(\eta_i+1) > h_{PH}(\eta_i)$ whereas in an AFT model $h_{AFT}(\eta_i+1) < h_{AFT}(\eta_i)$.
Secondly, the baseline risk now clearly depends on both time and the linear predictor.
Thirdly, an increase in a covariate results in a multiplicative increase over *time* compared to the PH model in which the hazard is increased -- this is often seen as more intuitive to understand than hazard ratio, especially to clinicians who may be more interested in survival times and not abstract relative risks.

This third point is visualised in @fig-phaft in which a covariate is increased by $\log(2)$.
The left panel shows that the estimated hazard function from a PH model is double the baseline at all time points -- the multiplicative effect is seen on the y-axis (risk).
In contrast, the right panel shows how the survival function from an AFT model decreases at double the speed to the baseline -- the multiplicative effects is now on the x-axis (time).
Another way to demonstrate this effect is through the log-linear form of the accelerated failure time model:

$$
\log(t_i) = \mu + \eta_i + \sigma\epsilon_i
$$ {#eq-aft-log}

where $\sigma$ is a scale parameter, $\epsilon_i$ is an error term, and $\mu$ is an intercept.
Now consider the difference in $t_i$ when $\eta_i$ is increased by one (assuming just one covariate):

$$
\log(t_i|x_i + 1) - \log(t_i|x_i) = (\mu + \beta (x_i + 1) + \sigma\epsilon_i) - (\mu + \beta x_i + \sigma\epsilon_i) = \beta
$$

Taking exponentials

$$
\frac{t_i|x_i + 1}{t_i|x_i} = \exp(\beta)
$$

Hence increasing a covariate effectively multiplies the survival time by $\exp(\beta)$:

$$
t_i|x_i + 1 = e^{\beta}t_i | x_i
$$

Whereas the result in the AFT is to multiply time $t$ by $2$, hence for any $t$, the AFT model reaches $S(t)$ in half the time as the baseline.](Figures/classical/compare.png){#fig-phaft fig-alt="TODO"}

### Parametric AFTs

As stated, AFTs are usually fully parametric, which means $S_0$ and $h_0$ are chosen according to some specific distribution.
Common distribution choices include Weibull, Exponential, Log-logistic, and Log-Normal  [@Kalbfleisch2011; @Wang2017].
The hazard function of the log-logistic distribution is plotted in @fig-logloghaz, note the hazard is non-monotonic, allowing non-PH representations to be modelled where the risk of an event may increase before decreasing, or vice versa.
When distributions are well-specified and the PH assumption is violated, AFTs can outperform PH alternatives [@Patel2006; @Qi2009; @Zare2015].

![Log-logistic hazard curves with a fixed scale parameter of 1 and a changing shape parameter. x-axis is time and y-axis is the log-logistic hazard as a function of time.](Figures/classical/llog_hazard.png){#fig-logloghaz fig-alt="TODO"}

As with the PH model, AFT models can be fit using maximum likelihood estimation of the full-likelihood by plugging in distribution defining functions into (@eq-aft-surv) and (@eq-aft-surv) and likelihoods defined in (@sec-surv-estimation-param).
Using Exponential this time as an example (the maths is a bit more friendly), first recall that if $X \sim \Exp(\lambda)$ then $h_X(\tau) = \lambda$ and $S_X(\tau) = \exp(-\lambda\tau)$.
Then:

$$
h_{ExpAFT}(\tau|\xx_i)= \lambda e^{-\eta_i}
$$

and

$$
S_{ExpAFT}(\tau|\xx_i)= \exp(-\lambda\tau e^{-\eta_i})
$$

Giving the ExpAFT likelihood (@sec-surv-estimation-param):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\calL(\bstheta) &= \prod_{i=1}^n h_Y(t_i|\bstheta)^{\delta_i}S_Y(t_i|\bstheta) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^n \Big(\lambda e^{-\eta_i})^{\delta_i}\Big(\exp(-\lambda t_i e^{-\eta_i})\Big) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda^{\delta_i} \exp(-\lambda t_i e^{-\eta_i} - \delta_i\eta_i) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

with log-likelihood

$$
\begin{aligned}
\call(\bstheta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \log(\lambda^{\delta_i} \exp(-\lambda t_i e^{-\eta_i} - \delta_i\eta_i)) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i\log(\lambda) - \lambda t_i e^{-\eta_i} - \delta_i\eta_i \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Likelihoods can also be derived using the log-linear form in (@eq-aft-log) however these are beyond the scope of this book.
As before, extensions to other censoring types and truncation follows by specifying the correct likelihood form from @sec-surv-estimation-param.

## Proportional Odds

Proportional odds models [@Bennett1983] are the final of the three major linear model classes in survival analysis.
In contrast to the PH and AFT models just discussed, proportional models are rarely, if ever, used on their own to make inferences about underlying data or as predictive models.
Instead they are more commonly found as components within neural networks (@sec-nnet) or in flexible parametric models (discussed next).
Therefore this section very briefly describes the motivation for the model and its key properties.

As the name may suggest, the proportional odds model is analogous to the proportional hazards model except with the goal of modelling odds instead of hazards.
For a given time $\tau$, the odds of an event happening at **at** $\tau$ are 

$$
O(\tau) = \frac{p(\tau)}{1 - p(\tau)}
$$

Where $p(\tau)$ is the probability of the event happening at $\tau$.
Of course as has been seen throughout this book the general interest is centered around the survival probability and therefore a more relevant quantity is the odds of the event not happening **before** $\tau$:

$$
O(\tau) = \frac{S(\tau)}{1-S(\tau)} = \frac{S(\tau)}{F(\tau)}
$$

By considering the same functional form as in the proportional hazards model, the proportional odds model follows analogously, subsituting odds in place of the hazards:

$$
O_{PO}(\tau|\xx_i) =  O_0(\tau)\exp(\eta_i)
$$

where $O_0$ is the baseline odds.

By the same logic as the proportional hazards model, this model assumes $O(\tau|\xx_i) \propto \exp(\eta_i)$ and that a unit increase in a covariate multiplies the odds of surviving past $t$ by $\exp(\eta_i)$.
A useful implication is the convergence of hazard functions, which states $h_i(\tau)/h_0(\tau) \rightarrow 1$ as $\tau \rightarrow \infty$ [@Kirmani2001].
To see this note that the PO model can be represented in terms of the hazard function via [@Collett2014]

$$
h_{PO}(\tau|\xx_i) =  h_0(\tau)\Bigg(1 - \frac{S_0(\tau)}{(\exp(\eta_i) - 1)^{-1} + S_0(\tau)} \Bigg)
$$ {#eq-po}

Dividing by the baseline hazard yields

$$
\frac{h_{PO}(\tau|\xx_i)}{h_0(\tau)} =  \Bigg(1 - \frac{S_0(\tau)}{(\exp(\eta_i) - 1)^{-1} + S_0(\tau)} \Bigg) =  \frac{(\exp(\eta_i) - 1)^{-1} }{(\exp(\eta_i) - 1)^{-1} + S_0(\tau)}
$$

Simplifying gives $(1 + S_0(\tau)(\exp(\eta_i) - 1))^{-1}$.
As $S_0(\tau) \rightarrow 0$ when $\tau \rightarrow \infty$, it follows that the hazard ratio tends to $1$ as $\tau$ increases.

This means that for any individual, their individual hazard approaches the baseline hazard over a long period of time.
This assumption holds in several contexts, commonly in medical domains in which death is the event of interest.
For example, take two patients with a disease, patient $i$ receives treatment and patient $j$ does not.
Let $\exp(\eta_i) = 4$, $\exp(\eta_j) = 1$, $S_0(0) = 1$, and $S_0(5) = 0.01$.
Following (@eq-po), we have for patient $i$

$$
h_{PO}(0|\xx_i) =  0.25h_0(0); \quad\quad h_{PO}(\tau|\xx_i) =  0.97h_0(5)
$$

and for patient $j$

$$
h_{PO}(0|\xx_j) = h_0(0); \quad\quad h_{PO}(5|\xx_j) = h_0(5)
$$

The treatment effect reduces the hazard for observation $i$ at early time-points.
However, at the later time-point, the hazard is very similar for both observations.

There is no simple closed form expression for the partial likelihood of a semi-parametric proportional odds model and hence in practice a Log-logistic distribution is usually assumed for the baseline odds and the model is fit by maximum likelihood estimation on the full likelihood [@Bennett1983], discussed further in the next section.

## Flexible Parametric Models {#sec-flexible}

Royston-Parmar flexible parametric models  [@Royston2002] extend PH and PO models by estimating the baseline hazard with natural cubic splines.
The model was designed to keep the form of the PH or PO methods but without being forced to estimate a misleading baseline hazard (for semi-parametric models) or missspecifying the survival distribution (for fully-parametric models).
This is achieved by fitting natural cubic splines in place of the baseline hazard.

The crux of the method is to use splines to model time on a log-scale and to either estimate the log cumulative Hazard for PH models,or the log Odds for PO models.
For the flexible PH model, a Weibull distribution is the basis for the baseline distribution, whereas a Log-logistic distribution is assumed for the baseline odds in the flexible PO model.
The exact derivation of the model requires a lot of mathematical exposition which is not included here, a very good summary of the model is given in @Collett2014. 
Instead, below is the model in its full form with an explanation of the variables and figures that demonstrate cubic splines.

The flexible parametric Royston-Parmar (RP) proportional hazards and proportional odds model are respectively defined by

$$
\log{H}_{RP}(\tau|\xx_i) = s(\tau|\bsgamma,\boldsymbol{k}) + \eta_i
$$ {#eq-rp-hazard}

$$
\log{O}_{RP}(\tau|\xx_i) = s(\tau|\bsgamma,\boldsymbol{k}) + \eta_i
$$ {#eq-rp-odds}

where $\bsgamma$ are spline coefficients to be estimated by maximum likelihood estimation, $\boldsymbol{k}$ are the positions of $K$ knots, and $s$ is the restricted cubic spline function in log time defined by

$$
s(\tau|\bsgamma,\boldsymbol{k}) = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1\log(\tau) + \gamma_2\nu_1(\log(\tau)) + ... + \gamma_{K}\nu_K(\log(\tau))
$$

$\nu_j$ is the basis function at knot $k_j$ defined by

$$
\nu_j(x) = (x - k_j)^3_+ - \lambda_j(x - k_{min})^3_+ - (1 - \lambda_j)(x - k_{max})^3_+
$$

where
$$
\lambda_j = \frac{k_{max} - k_j}{k_{max} - k_{min}}
$$

and $(x - y)_+ = \max\{0, (x - y)\}$ for any $x, y$, and where $k_{min}$ and $k_{max}$ are the boundaries of the cubic spline, meaning the curve is linear when $\log(t) < k_{min}$ or $\log(t) > k_{max}$.

To see how the proportional hazards RP model relates to the Weibull distribution, first we integrate and take logs of the Weibull-PH hazard function from equation (@eq-ph-weibull):

$$
\log(H_{WeibullPH}(\tau|\xx_i)) = \log\big((\lambda \tau^\gamma) \exp(\eta_i)\big) = \log(\lambda) + \gamma\log(\tau) + \eta_i
$$ 

Setting $\gamma_0 = \log(\lambda)$ and $\gamma_1 = \gamma$ yields (@eq-rp-hazard) when there are no knots.
Analogous results can be shown between (@eq-rp-odds) and the Log-logistic distribution.

To fit the model, the number and position of knots are theoretically tunable, although Royston and Parmar advised against tuning and suggest often only one internal knot is required and the placement of the knot does not make a significant difference to performance [@Royston2002].
Increasing knots can increase model overfitting however @Bower2019 showed up to seven knots does not significantly increase model bias.
The model's primary advantage is it's flexibility to model non-linear effects and can also be extended to time-dependent covariates.
Moreover, the model can be fit via maximum likelihood estimation and thus many standard off-shelf routines for estimating a smooth survival time function.
Despite advantages, the model appears to be limited in common use which makes it difficult to verify the model's utility across different contexts [@Ng2018].

In the same manner as other proportional hazards models, the Royston-Parmar model can be extended to competing risks by modelling cause-specific hazards, considering only one event at a time and censoring competing events [@Hinchliffe2013].

## Improving traditional models {#sec-classical-improving}

A number of model-agnostic algorithms have been created to improve a model's predictive ability.
When applied to traditional algorithms, these methods can be used to create powerful models that outperform other machine learning.
As each could be the subject of a whole book, this section remains brief and just covers the general overview.
These are split into methods for:

1. modelling non-linear data effects;
2. reducing the number of variables in a dataset; and
3. combining predictions from multiple models.

### Non-linear effects

One of the major limitations of the models discussed so far is the assumption of a linear relationship between covariates and outcomes (on the scale of the predictor).
At first one might view the Cox model as non-linear due to the presence of the exponential function.
However, the linearity becomes clear when the model is equivalently expressed as:

$$
\log\left(\frac{h(\tau|\xx_i)}{h_0(\tau)}\right) = x_1\beta_1 + ... x_p\beta_p
$$

Consider modelling the time until disease progression with covariates age (continuous) and treatment (binary):

$$
\log\left(\frac{h(\tau|\xx_i)}{h_0(\tau)}\right) = x_{age_i}\beta_{age} + x_{trt_i}\beta_{trt}
$$

In this form, increasing age from $1$ to $21$ or $81$ to $101$ has the same effect on the log hazard ratio; this is clearly not realistic.
There are many approaches to relaxing linearity; these are discussed extensively elsewhere and not repeated here, we recommend [@Hastie2013] which covers non-linear modelling in detail.

In brief, PH and AFT can be extended to _generalised additive models_ (GAM) in the 'usual' way.
For example for the Cox model,

$$
\log\left(\frac{h_i(\tau|\xx_i)}{h_0(\tau)}\right) = f_1(x_1) + ... + f_p(x_p)
$$

where each $f_j$ is a smooth, possibly non-linear function of its covariate. 
If all $f_j$ are the identity function then this reduces to the standard Cox model.
The functions $f_j$ are often chosen to be natural splines, but step functions, polynomial bases, or any other transformation can also be used.
The Royston-Parmar model (@sec-flexible) is a special case of a GAM where splines are used to model the baseline hazard.

### Dimension reduction and feature selection

In a predictive modelling problem, only a small subset of variables in datasets tend to be relevant for correctly predicting the outcome.
Other variables are either redundant -- they provide no more information than their counterparts -- or irrelevant -- they do not influence the outcome.
In these cases, using all variables for modelling results in worse interpretability, increased computational complexity, and often inferior model performance as model's tend to overfit the training data and generalise poorly to new data.

To improve model performance, one can therefore 'help' models by applying feature selection methods to reduce the number of variables in the dataset.
Feature selection is often grouped into three categories: 1) filters; 2) wrappers; and 3) embedded methods.
Wrappers fit multiple models on subsets of variables and select the best performing subsets, this is often computationally infeasible in the context of very large datasets, and as such have less relevance in survival analysis which often tackles very high-dimensional datasets such as genomic datasets and detailed time-series economic data.
This section only looks at methods specific to survival analysis and does not consider general algorithms such as PCA, see further reading below for suggested additional material that covers these areas.

#### Embedded methods {.unlisted .unnumbered}
Embedded methods refers to those that are incorporated during model fitting.
The vast majority of machine learning models incorporate embedded methods and thus reduce a dataset's size as part of the training process.
In contrast, models that do not apply any form of feature selection will perform poorly when there is a large number of variables in a dataset.
One model that straddles the line of 'traditional' and 'machine learning' methodology is the elastic Cox model, which incorporates the 'lasso' and 'ridge' regularization methods.
Given a generic learning algorithm, lasso and ridge regularization constrain the model coefficients subject to the $\cal{l}^1$-norm and $\cal{l}^2$-norm respectively.
The Lasso-Cox [@Tibshirani1997] model fits the Cox model in (@eq-cox) by estimating $\bsbeta$ as

$$
\hat{\bsbeta} = \argmax \calL(\bsbeta); \text{ subject to } \sum |\beta_j| \leq \gamma
$$

where $\calL$ is the likelihood defined in (@eq-partial) and $\gamma > 0$ is a hyper-parameter.

In contrast, the Ridge-Cox model estimates $\bsbeta$ as 

$$
\hat{\bsbeta} = \argmax \calL(\bsbeta); \text{ subject to } \sum \beta_j^2 \leq \gamma
$$

Ridge and lasso are both shrinkage methods, which are used to reduce model variance and overfitting, especially in the context of multi-collinearity.
However, the $\call^1$ norm in Lasso regression can also shrink coefficients to zero and thus performs variable selection as well.
It is therefore possible to incorporate a feature selection method first and then pass the results to a Ridge-Cox model -- though experiments have shown Ridge-Cox on its own is already a powerful tool [@Spooner2020].
Alternatively, as with many machine learning algorithms, deciding between lasso and ridge can be performed in empirical benchmark experiments by using elastic net [@Simon2011;@Zou2005], which is a convex combination of $\call^1$ and $\call^2$ penalties such that $\bsbeta$ is estimated as

$$
\hat{\bsbeta} = \argmax \calL(\bsbeta); \text{ subject to } \alpha \sum |\beta_j| + (1-\alpha) \sum \beta_j^2 \leq \gamma
$$

where $\alpha$ is a hyper-parameter to be tuned.

#### Filter methods {.unlisted .unnumbered}
Filter methods are a two-step process that score features according to some metric and then select either a given number of top-performing features (i.e., have the best score) or those where the score exceeds some threshold.
Once again determining the number of features to select, or the threshold to exceed, can be performed via hyperparameter optimisation.
@Bommert2021 compared 14 filter methods for high-dimensional survival data by extending existing methods, making use of tools seen throughout this book including non-parametric estimators, martingale residuals, and inverse probability of censoring weighting.
However, the authors found that the method that outperformed all others was a simple variance filter:

$$
V(\xx_{;j}) = \text{Var}(\xx_{;j})
$$

where $\xx_{;j}$ is the $j$th variable in the data and $V$ is the resulting score.
The filter measures the amount of variance in the feature and removes features that have little variation.

Another common filter method is to train another model and make use of its embedded feature selection and pass these results to a simpler model.
This allows a traditional model to be trained on relevant features without loss to interpretability or performance.
Common choices for models to use in the first step of the pipeline include random forests (@sec-ranfor) and gradient boosting machines (@sec-boost).

### Ensemble methods

Ensemble methods fit multiple models and combine the result into a single prediction.
Common ensemble methods include boosting, bagging, and stacking.
These are briefly explained below and can be applied to any model, whether machine learning or a simple linear model.
Note that nested cross-validation should be used when fitting any of the models below in order to ensure no data is 'leaked' between training and predictions (@sec-ml-opt).

#### Bagging and averaging {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The simplest ensemble method is to fit multiple models on the same data and make predictions by taking an average over the individual model predictions.
The average over predictions could be uniform, weighted with weights selected through expert knowledge, or weighted with weights optimised as hyper-parameters.
Ensemble methods perform best when there is high variance between models as each then captures unique information about the underlying data.
Therefore ensemble averaging is more common after first subsetting the training data and training each model on a different subset.

Whilst increasing variance is beneficial, too much variance may result in worse predictions.
Hence, bagging (Bootstrap AGGregatING) is a common approach to increase variance without losing predictive accuracy.
Bootstrapping is the process of sampling data with replacement, meaning the rows may be duplicated in each subset -- this is discussed further in @sec-ranfor.
After sampling the process is the same with predictions made and averaged.

#### Model-based boosting {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Model-based boosting fits a sequence of models that iteratively improve model performance by correcting the previous model's mistakes.
The initial model is trained as usual on a testing dataset, and subsequent models are fit on the same features but using 'pseudo-residuals' as targets (a regression problem).
These pseudo-residuals are the negative gradient of a chosen loss from the previous iteration -- this is discussed in detail in @sec-boost.
The result is a gradual increase in improvement as each model captures patterns missed previously.
In a survival analysis context, many of the losses discussed in Part II can be used in this pipeline, with the choice of loss dependent on the task of interest.
Model-based boosting is a generic pipeline which may underperform the purpose-built algorithms discussed in @sec-boost.

#### Stacking {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Stacking can improve model performance by fitting multiple models and aggregating the predictions using a meta-model.
Fitting a meta-model, often a simple linear model, results in fitted coefficients that weight the input models according to how close or far they were from the truth.

Training data is partitioned (once or several times) and the first partition is used to train several independent models, a meta-model is fit using the outputs (predictions) from the base models as features and the targets $(t_i,\delta_i)$ from the second partition as targets.

As an example, take stacking three Cox models with a Cox meta-model.
Let $\calD = \{(\xx_i, t_i, \delta_i)\}$ be a dataset.
Partition $\calD$ into two disjoint datasets $\calD_1$ of size $n$ and $\calD_2$ of size $m$.
Three Cox base models are fit on $\calD_1$ and linear predictors are obtained (predicted) for all $m$ observations in $\calD_2$:

$$
Z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{\eta}^{(1)}_{1} & \cdots & \hat{\eta}^{(3)}_{1} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\hat{\eta}^{(1)}_{m} & \cdots & \hat{\eta}^{(3)}_{m} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\hat{\eta}^{(j)}_{i}$ is the linear predictor for the $i$th observation in the validation set from the $j$th base model.

Fit the meta-Cox model on $(Z, (t_i, \delta_i)_{i \in \calD_2})$:

$$
h_M(\tau|\hat{\bseta}_i) = h^{(M)}_{0}(\tau)\exp(\beta^{(M)}_1\hat{\eta}^{(1)}_{i} + \beta^{(M)}_2\hat{\eta}^{(2)}_{i} + \beta^{(M)}_3\hat{\eta}^{(3)}_{i}), \quad i \in \calD_2
$$

Finally, the base learners are refit on all $\calD$ but keeping $\hat{\bsbeta}^{(M)}$ and $\hat{h}^{(M)}_0$ from the meta-model fixed.

Predictions for a new observation, $\xx^*$ are made by first predicting $(\hat{\eta}_*^{(1)},\hat{\eta}_*^{(2)},\hat{\eta}_*^{(3)})$ from the trained base models and passing those to $h_M$ using the fitted $\hat{\bsbeta}^{(M)}$ coefficients and $\hat{h}^{(M)}_0$.

In the above example, Cox models are used throughout.
However, any machine learning models with the same prediction types can be stacked, including combinations of models.

## Conclusion

:::: {.callout-warning icon=false}

## Key takeaways

* Traditional statistical models broadly fall into three categories: non-parametric estimators, semi-parametric models that include a baseline estimate, and fully-parametric estimates. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
* Non-parametric estimators are used throughout survival analysis, often as components in more complex machine learning models.
* Proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models encode different assumptions but both are powerful tools for learning patterns from data and even in prediction problems.
* The boundary between machine learning and statistical models is fuzzy, and simpler survival models can outperform more complex machine learning alternatives.

:::: {.callout-important icon=false}

## Limitations

* Several models can be extended to time-dependent covariates however these are not well-developed for predictive problems.
* Simpler (linear) models encode assumptions that are rarely met in practice, for example the proportional hazards assumption. However, even if assumptions are violated, these could still generalise well to new data and are therefore worth including in benchmark experiments.
* Unregularized models perform badly on high-dimensional data without some form of pre-processing, however this is relatively simple with modern off-shelf software such as $\pkg{sklearn}$ and $\pkg{mlr3}$.
