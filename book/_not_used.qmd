# survival

(@tab-surv-data-abs) exemplifies a random survival dataset with $n$ observations (rows) and $p$ features.

| $\mathbf{x}_{;1}$ | $\mathbf{x}_{;2}$ | $\mathbf{x}_{;p}$ | $T$ | $\Delta$ | $Y$ | $C$ |
| -- | -- | --- | -- | --| -- | -- |
| $X_{11}$ | $\cdots$ | $X_{1p}$ | $T_1$ | $\Delta_1$ | $Y_1$ | $C_1$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\ddots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| $X_{n1}$ | $\cdots$ | $X_{np}$ | $T_n$ | $\Delta_n$ | $Y_n$ | $C_n$ |

: Theoretical time-to-event dataset. $(Y,C)$ are 'hypothetical' as they can never be directly observed. Rows are individual observations, $X$ columns are features, $T$ is observed time-to-event, $\Delta$ is the censoring indicator, and $(Y,C)$ are hypothetical true survival and censoring times. {#tbl-surv-data-abs}

The estimated prediction functional $\hatg$ is fit on training data $\{(\xx_1,t_1,\delta_1),...,(\xx_n,t_n,\delta_n)\} \in \dtrain$ and is considered good if $\EE[L(T^*, \Delta^*, \hatg(X^*))]$ is low, where $(X^*, T^*, \Delta^*) \sim (X, T, \Delta)$ is independent of $(X_1,T_1,\Delta_1),...,(X_n,T_n,\Delta_n)$ and $\hatg$.


## competing risks notation

To introduce the competing risks setting more formally, let $Y$ be the time-to-event as before.
In the competing risks setting, there is now an additional random variable $E\in \{1,\ldots,q\}$ with realizations $e$, which denotes one of $q$ competing events that can occur at event time $Y$.
The survival outcome notation, $(Y, \Delta)$, thus has to be extended to accommodate for the possibility of competing risks.
Previously, we defined the status indicator $\Delta \in \{0,1\}$ for right-censored data.
In the competing risks setting we have $\Delta = I(Y_i \leq C_i) \wedge E_i = e$, such that
$\Delta \in \{0, 1, \ldots, q\}$ where $\Delta = 0$ indicates censoring as before (that is subject remained in state 0 until end of follow up) and $\Delta = e$ means the $e$th event occurred.
Rather than estimating the distribution of event times $P(Y\leq \tau)$, the goal is to estimate the joint distribution of $Y$ and $E$, $P(Y\leq \tau, E=e)$.



## recurrent events



## Recurrent Events {#sec-recurrent-events}

The *recurrent events* setting is defined by the same event type occurring multiple times.
While the recurrent events setting can be viewed as a special case of the multi-state setting (@sec-multi-state), we treat it here separately as it can also be approached as single event data with correlation.
Some examples of recurrent events include recurrence of infectious diseases, episodes of epilepsy, and replacements of machine parts.

@tbl-cgd-data shows data of chronic granolotomous disease (CGD) for two subjects.
Note the start-stop notation of the data ($t_{start}, t_{stop}$ respectively) that indicates the time in which a subject enters the risk set for the k*th* event number.
The column $\delta$ indicates whether the subject experienced the $k$th outbreak or was censored.
For example, Subject 1 (first three rows) experienced the first outbreak (first row) after 219 days, at which time they entered the risk set for event number 2.
The second event (second row) was experienced at 373 days and the subject was then censored for the third event (third row) after 414 days.
This notation is equivalent to a multi-state representation of the recurrent events process, where each event number represents a different state.
In @fig-recurrent-events, right panel, this is refered to as "Clock forward" approach.

| ID| $k$ | $t_{start}$| $t_{stop}$|$\delta$|$gap$|
|--:|---:|---:|------:|--:|-----:|
|  1|1|  0 | 219|   1| 219|
|  1|2|219 | 373|   1| 154|
|  1|3|373 | 414|   0|  41|
|  7|1|  0 | 292|   1| 292|
|  7|2|292 | 364|   0|  72|
: Subset of the `cgd`  [@pkgsurvival] time-to-event dataset.
Rows are individual observation units ($ID$), $k$ is the $k$th event occurrence, $t_{start}$ and $t_{stop}$ mark the beginning and end of the "at risk time" for the $k$th event occurence, $\delta$ is the event indicator and $gap = t_{stop} - t_{start}$. {#tbl-cgd-data}

For recurrent events data without competing (terminal) events, the "Clock reset" approach (@fig-recurrent-events, left panel) can be used.
Instead of representing the data in the start-stop notation, the gap time is calculated instead (see fourth column in @tbl-cgd-data).
In this representation, we only consider how long the subject was at risk for the $k$th event, not at which time (on the calendar time scale).
It has the advantage that standard methods for analysis of single-event data can be used for modeling.
However, the resulting dependency between multiple data points from one subject (at risk for multiple events at the same time) needs to be taken into account in the modeling step.

![Illustration of transitions in the recurrent events setting. Left: "Clock reset" representation of recurrent events. Each time an event occurs, the clock is reset to 0 and we once again wait for occurence of an event (of the same type); Right: "Clock forward" representation. A subject transitions from 1st, to 2nd, etc. to $K$th event occurence](Figures/survival/recurrent-events.png){#fig-recurrent-events fig-alt="Schematic illustration of recurrent events transitions."}

The distribution of event recurrences per subject is often right-skewed in real data sets, which implies that there are only few events past event number $e^*$.
In practice, therefore, the data is often summarized such that we have event numbers $e = 1,\ldots, e^*_+$, where $e^*_+$ represents category "$e^*$ or higher".


## transition probabilities

Increasing the number of intervals to infinity or equivalently, reducing the interval size to infinitesimally small intervals $du$ where only one transition can be observed, leads to a product integral over the instantaneous transition probabilities $p_{\ell e}(u)$ (@eq-ms-instantaneous-trans-prob), such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P}(\zeta, \tau) & = \lim_{\du \rightarrow 0}\prod_{u \in (\zeta, \tau]}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{00}(u) & \cdots & p_{0q}(u)\\
    \vdots                  & \ddots & \vdots\\
    p_{q0}(u)  & \cdots & p_{qq}(u)\\
  \end{pmatrix}
