# Preface

> "Everything happens to everybody sooner or later if there is time enough" - George Bernard Shaw

> "...but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." - Benjamin Franklin

These quotes aptly describe the core assumptions of survival analysis (specifically single-event analysis, but we'll get to that later).
In the simplest application, the goal of predictive survival analysis is to estimate the probability of an event occurring over time, with the assumption that the event _should_ occur at some point.
Survival analysis places significant emphasis on that word 'should'.
Given enough time, and no extraneous events, the event of interest _should_ happen.
However, time is finite and occasionally competing events can prevent the target under investigation.

For example, a runner _should_ finish a race.
However, they may fail to do so if they take _so_ long that the race ends, if the person next to them falls over and causes pile-up, or if they collapse from exhaustion.
Therefore, there is uncertainty about _if_ they will finish the race and _when_.
Survival analysis differs from other fields of statistics in that this uncertainty is explicitly encoded in the survival problem, as 'censoring'.
Instead of being excluded from a dataset, the runner is said to have been censored at the time at which they are no longer running the race.
There are also different mechanisms for censoring; indeed, in the examples above we illustrated several different censoring mechanisms, which will be discussed in detail in this book.
Censoring is central to survival analysis, and without the presence of censoring, survival analysis is mathematically equivalent to regression on the fully observed event times.

This book focuses entirely on predictive survival analysis (which we refer to simply as 'survival analysis'), which is focused on forward-looking predictions.
This is in contrast to inference methods, which examine model parameters to learn information about a given dataset or model.
Predictive survival analysis is a hugely important area of statistics, with numerous applications across a wide variety of industries, for example:

* Manufacturing: Predict the time to equipment failure;
* Pharmaceutical: Predict a patient's survival trajectory after novel treatment;
* Healthcare: Predict a patient's survival time after infection with meningitis;
* Finance: Predict the time until a customer defaults on a loan;
* Marketing: Predict the risk of a customer churning;
* E-commerce: Predict the time until next purchase for personalized marketing;

And many, many more examples.

Despite its importance in many real-world settings, survival analysis has lagged behind other predictive fields such as classification and regression.
This gap may be in part due to the sensitive and highly regulated domains in which survival analysis is typically applied.
In these environments, 'black-box models', models that are difficult to interpret, may be less appealing than transparent linear models that can be implemented easily using graphical, non-programming tools such as Excel.
The longer this gap persists, the harder it will become for practitioners to adopt modern methods and the more resistance will build.

The rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) with tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, puts the field of survival analysis at an interesting fork.
Traditional machine learning methods, those not using genAI, are deeply embedded in industry for regression and classification, with extensive experience and evidence indicating where these methods do and do not succeed; allowing for a measured and evidence-based transition to genAI.
In contrast, the slower adoption of machine learning in survival analysis means the field could leapfrog technologies directly to genAI approaches.
We are already seeing vendors selling genAI survival analysis tools to private- and public-sector organizations.
Behind the scenes, some of these tools are writing code in Python or R to build machine learning survival analysis models, with limited (or no) human scrutiny.
Therefore, we argue, now more than ever, there is an urgent need for machine learning survival analysis models to be widely understood.

This book focuses entirely on 'traditional machine learning'.
We do not advocate for or against genAI in survival analysis.
Instead, we hope to equip practitioners with a solid grounding of traditional techniques so they can choose among methodologies rather than defaulting to genAI simply because it becomes the norm.
Further, we hope that more understanding of traditional methods will also support practitioners in evaluating external technologies.


**A note from Raphael**:
I wrote my PhD thesis about machine learning applications to survival analysis because I was interested in understanding why more researchers were not using machine learning models for survival analysis.
Since then, I feel that little has changed, even with the rapid rise of generative AI.
The field continues to lag behind but now with more challenges than ever.
Over the years, I've had the pleasure to work with, and advise, researchers across different sectors, including pharmaceutical companies, governmental agencies, funding organizations, and research institutions.
I hope that this book continues to help researchers discover machine learning survival analysis and to navigate the nuances and complexities it presents.

## Overview of the book

This book is intended to fill a gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive introduction to machine learning in the survival setting.
If you are interested in machine learning or survival analysis separately, then you might consider @Hastie2013; @Hastie2001; or @Bishop2006 for machine learning and @Collett2014 or @KalbfleischPrentice1973 for survival analysis.
This book serves as a complement to the above works and introduces common machine learning terminology from simpler settings such as regression and classification, but without diving into the detail found in other sources; instead focusing on extensions to survival analysis.

This book may be useful for Master's or PhD students who are specializing in machine learning in survival analysis, machine learning engineers looking to solve problems involving censoring, or practitioners familiar with survival analysis but with less applied machine learning experience.
The book can be read cover-to-cover, but we believe it will be more useful as a reference book for you to dip into as required.

Following the introduction, this book is structured in four parts:

**Part I: Machine Learning and Survival Analysis**<br>
An introduction to the basics of survival analysis, with some more advanced concepts in the more general 'event history analysis' setting, which encompasses competing risks and multi-state models.
In addition, there is a brief overview to machine learning, including key concepts that are utilized throughout the survival domain.
This Part concludes by unifying terminology between machine learning and survival analysis to define what it means to have different survival prediction problems and a 'machine learning survival analysis' task. 

**Part II: Evaluation**<br>
The second part of the book discusses model evaluation.
Evaluation is crucial for choosing between models and eventually trusting the predictions from a trained machine learning model.
Part II introduces measures for evaluating the different types of predictive task introduced in Part I.
In each chapter, the measure class is introduced, specific metrics are listed, and commentary is provided on how and when to use the measures.
Recommendations for choosing measures are discussed in the final chapter of the book.
As this book focuses on the predictive setting, the evaluation measures introduced in Part II are all 'out-of-sample' measures, to be used for evaluating models on new, unseen data.
This is in contrast to 'in-sample' measures, which evaluate how well a model is fit to data, and are usually preferred for inference tasks.
Readers who are interested in in-sample measures are directed to @Collett2014 and @dataapplied for discussion on residuals; @Choodari2012a and @Royston2004 for $R^2$ type measures; and @VolinskyRaftery2000; @HURVICH1989, and @Liang2008 for information criterion measures.

**Part III: Models**<br>
Part III is a deep dive into models for solving survival analysis problems.
This begins with 'traditional survival' models that may not be considered 'machine learning' by some; although, as will be shown, with a small level of tweaking, these models can be exceptionally powerful.
This Part of the book continues by exploring different classes of machine learning models including random forests, support vector machines, gradient boosting machines, and neural networks.
Whilst this book does not go into extensive detail about deep learning, the final chapter of this Part provides a foundation that can be complemented by works such as @Goodfellow2016.

Each model class is introduced in classification or regression settings with extensions to survival analysis then discussed.
Differences between model implementations are not discussed, that is, there is not extensive detail on whether one specific algorithm is superior to another.
Instead, the focus is on understanding how these models are built for survival analysis
In this way, readers are well-equipped to independently follow papers that introduce specific implementations.

**Part IV: Reduction Techniques**<br>
The final Part introduces reduction techniques, which are methods to solve survival analysis problems by using methods from other fields.
In particular, chapters focus on demonstrating the close connections between competing risks, discrete time, Poisson, classification, and regression settings.
Practitioners who are comfortable with other machine learning fields may find this Part of the book most useful for quickly implementing familiar models within the survival analysis domain.

The book's final chapter lists common practical problems that occur when running survival analysis experiments, as well as solutions that we have found useful.
We additionally provide our outlook on survival analysis and where we think the field may be heading.
