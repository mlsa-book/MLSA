# Survival Time Measures {#sec-eval-det}

As discussed in @sec-survtsk, any evaluation of survival time point predictions is misleading.
Restricting evaluation to uncensored observations and using standard regression measures such as the mean absolute error (MAE) can introduce substantial bias [@Wang2017].

@Qi2023 survey survival losses based on the MAE, including a hinge loss introduced by @Chapfuwa2018, as well as losses based on surrogate values including mean residual lifetime [@Haider2020] and pseudo-observations.
They found that attempting to use an IPCW-weighted MAE does not produce more accurate ranking than use of the unweighted MAE.
Whilst their pseudo-observation based approach is shown to induce the same rankings as the true MAE (generated from synthetic data), this does not eliminate the fundamental ambiguity associated with evaluating survival times in the presence of censoring.

## Key takeaways

* Attempting to evaluate survival time predictions will always be misleading.
