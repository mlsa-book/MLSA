# Symbols and Notation {.unnumbered}

{{< include _wip.qmd >}}

The most common symbols and notation used throughout this book are presented below; in rare cases where different meanings are intended within the book, this will be made clear.

A lower-case letter in normal font, $x$, refers to a single, fixed observation.
When in bold font, a lower-case letter, $\xx$, refers to a vector of fixed observations, and an upper-case letter, $\XX$, represents a matrix.
A letter in normal font with a single subscript, refers to a single element from a vector, for example $x_i$ would be the $i$th element in vector $\xx$, whereas two subscripts refer to a single element from a matrix, for example $x_{ij}$ would be the element in the $i$th row and $j$th column of matrix $\XX$.
When referring to a row of a matrix, $X$, then a subscript is used with a bold-face lower-case letter, for example the $i$th row would be $\xx_i$, in contrast the $j$th column would be written as $\xx_{;j}$.
Calligraphic letters, $\calX$, are used to denote sets.

A matrix will always be defined with its dimensions using the notation, $\XX \in \calX^{n \times p}$ or if $\calX$ is the set of Reals, it may be written as "$\XX$ is a $n \times p$ Real-valued matrix".
By default, a 'vector' will refer to a column vector, which may be thought of as a matrix with $n$ rows and one column, and in long-form may be represented as:

$$
\begin{align}
  \xx &= \begin{pmatrix}
          x_1 \\
          x_2 \\
          \vdots \\
          x_n
        \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

For simplicity, vectors are instead defined using transpose notation, for example the vector above may instead be written as $\xx^\trans = (x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n)$ or $\xx = (x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n)^\trans$.
If the elements of a vector are unimportant, then the vector may be more simply defined as, $\xx \in \calX^n$.

Typically, a 'hat', $\hat{x}$, will refer to the prediction or estimation of a variable, $x$, with bold-face used again to represent vectors.
A 'bar', $\bar{x}$, refers to the sample mean of $\xx$.
Capital letters in normal font, $X$, refer to scalar or vector random variables, which will be made clear from context.
$\EE(X)$ and $\Var(X)$ are the expectation and mean of the random variable $X$ respectively.
A function $f$, will either be written as a formal map of domain to codomain, $f: \calX \rightarrow \calY; (x, y) \mapsto f(x, y)$ (which is most useful for understanding inputs and outputs), or more simply and commonly as $f(x, y)$.
Given a random variable, $X$, following distribution $\zeta$ (mathematically written $X \sim \zeta$), then $f_X$ denotes the probability density function, and analogously for other distribution defining functions.
In the survival analysis context (@sec-surv), a subscript "$0$" refers to a "baseline" function, for example, $S_0$ is the baseline survival function.
