# Symbols and Notation {.unnumbered}

{{< include _wip.qmd >}}

The most common symbols and notation used throughout this book are presented below; in rare cases where different meanings are intended within the book, this will be made clear.

Lower- and upper-case letters, $x, X$, refer to fixed observations and random variables respectively.
Bold-face is used to refer to matrices, $\xx$, and calligraphic letters for sets, $\calX$.
Subscripts denote elements in vectors, $x_i$, with two subscripts used to denote rows and columns in matrices, $x_{ij}$, a semi-colon refers to the whole row or column, $x_{i;}$ and $x_{;j}$, respectively.
Typically, a 'hat', $\hat{x}$, will refer to the prediction or estimation of a variable, $x$, and a 'bar', $\bar{x}$, refers to the sample mean of $x$.
$\EE(X)$ and $\Var(X)$ are the expectation and mean of the random variable $X$ respectively.
A function $f$, will either be written as a formal map of domain to codomain, $f: \calX \rightarrow \calY; (x, y) \mapsto f(x, y)$ (which is most useful for understanding inputs and outputs), or more simply and commonly as $f(x, y)$.
Given a random variable, $X$, following distribution $\zeta$ (mathematically written $X \sim \zeta$) we denote $f_X$ to be the probability density function, and analogously for other distribution defining functions.
In the survival analysis context (@sec-surv), a subscript "$0$" refers to a "baseline" function, for example, $S_0$ is the baseline survival function.

Common variables and acronyms used in the book are given in @tbl-not-var and @tbl-not-acr respectively.

| Variable | Definition |
| - | ---- |
| $\Reals, \PReals, \NNReals, \ExtReals$|Set of Reals, positive Reals (excl. zero), non-negative Reals (incl. zero), and Reals including $\pm\infty$. |
| $\PNaturals$|Set of Naturals excluding zero. |
| $(\xx, y, c, t, \delta)$ | Survival data where $x$ are features, $y, c$ are hypothetical survival and censoring times, $t = \min(y, c)$ and $\delta = \II(t = y)$ where $\II$ is the indicator function ($1$ if the containing statement is true and $0$ otherwise). |
| $\beta$|Vector of model coefficients/weights. |
| $\eta$|Linear predictor, $X\beta$. |
| $\calD, \dtrain, \dtest$| Dataset, training data, and testing data. |
