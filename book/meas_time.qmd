# Evaluating Survival Time {#sec-eval-det}

{{< include _wip.qmd >}}

There appears to be little research into measures for evaluating survival time predictions, which is likely due to this task usually being of less interest than the others (@sec-surv-set-types). Common measures in survival analysis for survival time predictions are the same as regression measures but with an additional indicator variable to remove censoring. Three common regression measures are the mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). These are respectively defined for survival analysis as

## Survival time measures

Let $\calT^m \subseteq \PReals^m$, $\hatt = \hatt_1,...,\hatt_m, t = t_1,...,t_m$, $\delta = \delta_1,...,\delta_m$, and $d := \sum^m_{i=1} \delta_i$, then

i. The *censoring-adjusted mean absolute error*, $MAE_C$ is defined by

$$
MAE_C: \calT^m \times \calT^m \times \bset^m \rightarrow \NNReals; (\hatt, t, \delta) \mapsto \frac{1}{d} \sum^m_{i=1} \delta_i|t_i - \hat{t_i}|
$$
i. The *censoring-adjusted mean squared error*, $MSE_C$ is defined by

$$
MSE_C: \calT^m \times \calT^m \times \bset^m \rightarrow \NNReals; (\hatt, t, \delta) \mapsto \frac{1}{d}\sum^m_{i=1}\delta_i(t_i - \hatt_i)^2
$$
i. The *censoring-adjusted root mean squared error*, $RMSE_C$ is defined by

$$
RMSE_C: \calT^m \times \calT^m \times \bset^m \rightarrow \NNReals; (\hatt, t, \delta) \mapsto \sqrt{MSE_C(t, \hat{t}, \delta)}
$$

These are referred to as 'distance' measures as they measure the distance between the true, $(t, \delta)$, and predicted, $\hatt$, values. This approach is not ideal as the removal of censored observations results in increased bias as the proportion of censoring increases (@sec-eval-crank-disc-conc). Furthermore these measures make some assumptions that are likely not valid in a survival setting. For example these metrics assume that an over-prediction should be penalised equally as much as an under-prediction, whereas in survival data it is likely that a model should be overly-cautious and under-predict survival times, i.e. it is safer to predict a patient is more at risk and will die sooner rather than less risk and die later.

These measures are clearly transparent and accessible as off-shelf implementation is straightforward, though $\proba$ [@pkgmlr3proba] was the only $\Rstats$ package found to implement these. For performance, no conclusions can be drawn as no research could be found into the theoretical properties of these losses; despite this there is evidence of them being utilised in the literature [@Wang2017].
