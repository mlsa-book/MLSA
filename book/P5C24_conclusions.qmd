## Common problems in survival analysis {#sec-conclusions-faq}

### Data cleaning

#### Events at t=0 {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Throughout this book we have defined survival times taking values in the non-negative Reals (zero inclusive) $\NNReals$.
In practice, model implementations assume time is over the positive Reals (zero exclusive).
One must therefore consider how to deal with subjects that experience the outcome at $0$. 
There is no established best practice for dealing with this case as the answer may be data-dependent.
Possible choices include:

1. Deleting all data where the outcome occurs at $t=0$, this may be appropriate if it only happens in a small number of observations and therefore deletion is unlikely to bias predictions;
2. Update the survival time to the next smallest observed survival time. For example, if the first observation to experience the event after $t=0$ happens at $t=0.1$, then set $0.1$ as the survival time for any observation experiencing the event at $t=0$. Note this method will not be appropriate when data is over a long period, for example if measuring time over years, then there could be a substantial difference between $t=0$ and $t=1$;
3. Update the survival time to a very small value $\epsilon$ that makes sense given the context of the data, e.g., $\epsilon = 0.0001$.

#### Continuous v Discrete Time {.unnumbered .unlisted}

We defined survival tasks throughout this book assuming continuous time predictions in $\NNReals$.
In practice, many outcomes in survival analysis are recorded on a discrete scale, such as in medical statistics where outcomes are observed on a yearly, daily, monthly, hourly, etc. basis.
Whilst discrete-time survival analysis exists for this purpose (@sec-discrete), software implementations overwhelming use theory from the 'continuous-time setting.
There has not been a lot of research into whether discrete-time methods outperform continuous-time methods when correctly applied to discrete data, however available experiments do not indicate that discrete methods outperform their continuous counterparts [@Suresh2022].
Therefore it is recommended to use available software implementations, even when data is recorded on a discrete scale.
