# Symbols and Notation {.unnumbered}

The most common symbols and notation used in this book are presented below.
We will do our best to stick to these throughout but any deviations will be made clear from context.

## Matrices and vectors

A lower-case letter in normal font, $x$, refers to a single, fixed observation.
When in bold font, a lower-case letter, $\xx$, refers to a vector of fixed observations, and an upper-case letter, $\XX$, represents a matrix.
Calligraphic letters, $\calX$, are used to denote sets.

A matrix will always be defined with its dimensions using the notation, $\XX \in \calX^{n \times p}$, or if for example $\calX$ is the set of Reals, it may be written as "$\XX$ is a $n \times p$ Real-valued matrix", analogously for matrices of Integers, Naturals, etc.
By default, a 'vector' will refer to a column vector, which may be thought of as a matrix with $n$ rows and one column, and may be represented as:

$$
\xx = \begin{pmatrix}
        x_1 \\
        x_2 \\
        \vdots \\
        x_n
      \end{pmatrix}
$$

Vectors are usually defined using transpose notation, for example the vector above may instead be written as $\xx^\trans = (x_1 \ x_2 \cdots x_n)$ or $\xx = (x_1 \ x_2 \cdots x_n)^\trans$.
Vectors may also be defined in a shortened format as $\xx \in \calX^n$, which implies a column vector of length $n$ with elements as represented above.

Let $\XX \in \calX^{n \times p}$ be a matrix.
A letter in normal font with two subscripts is used to reference a single element of a matrix, for example $x_{i,j} \in \calX$ would be the element in the $i$th row and $j$th column of $\XX$.
A bold-face, lower-case letter with a single subscript refers to a row of a matrix, for example the $i$th row of $\XX$ would be $\xx_i = (x_{i,1} \ x_{i,2} \cdots x_{i,p})^\trans$.
Note that whilst $\xx_i$ refers to the row of a matrix, we continue to use the column vector notation to maintain the convention that vectors are column-vectors.
A column is referenced with a dot in place of the row index, for example the $j$th column of $\XX$ would be $\xx_{\cdot j} = (x_{1,j} \ x_{2,j} \cdots x_{n,j})^\trans$.
A letter in normal font with one subscript refers to a single element from a vector.
For example, given $\xx \in \calX^n$, the $i$th element is denoted $x_i$.

## Functions

Typically, a 'hat', $\hat{x}$, will refer to the prediction or estimation of a variable, $x$, with bold-face used again to represent vectors.
A 'bar', $\bar{x}$, refers to the sample mean of a vector $\xx$.
Capital letters in normal font, $X$, refer to scalar or vector random variables, which will be made clear from context.
$\EE(X)$ is the expectation of the random variable $X$.

$f: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ denotes a function $f$ from some domain $\mathcal{A}$ to some codomain $\mathcal{B}$.
Given a random variable, $X$, then $f_X$ denotes the probability density function, and analogously for other distribution defining functions such as the cumulative distribution function, survival function, etc.
In the context of probability distributions, a subscript $0$ refers to a baseline function, for example, $S_0$ is the baseline survival function.

Let $B(\omega)$ be a logical statement, then $\II(B(\omega))$ denotes the indicator function, defined as

$$
\II(B(\omega))=
\begin{cases}
1 && \text{if } B(\omega) \text{ is true }, \\
0 && \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Finally, $\exp$, refers to the exponential function, $f(x) = e^x$, and $\log$ refers to the natural logarithm $\ln(x) = \log_e(x)$.
