In this case does it still make sense to use the prognostic index in the function if the index is coming from a Weibull model vs Cox model? Is the interpretation the same... Are there equivalents for AFTs that can be compared to PHs? Or is concordance index always the best and therefore the one measure that should be used? Do we care at all about distance measures such as brier or logloss that instead compare the true time to event to the predicted time to event? As opposed to comparing the concordance of the linear predictor to the even time},
