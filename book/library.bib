abstract = {Clinicians are sometimes reluctant to discuss prognosis with parents of children with life-threatening illness, usually because they worry about the emotional impact of this information. However, parents often want this prognostic information because it underpins informed decision-making, especially near the end of life. In addition, despite understandable clinician concerns about its emotional impact, prognostic disclosure can actually support hope and peace of mind among parents struggling to live with a child's illness. Children, too, may need to understand what is ahead to manage uncertainty and make plans for the ways their remaining life will be lived. In this article, we describe the ethical issues involved in disclosure of prognostic information to parents and children with life-threatening illness and offer practical guidance for these conversations.},

This problem involves analysing data of times to relapse of patients and relating them to prognostic variables. Some of the times to relapse will usually be censored.We investigate various ways of using neural network models to extend traditional statistical models in this situation. Such models are better able to model both non-linear effects of prognostic factors and interactions between them, than linear logistic or Cox regression models. With the dataset used in our study, however, the prediction of the risk of relapse is not significantly improved when using a neural network model. Predicting the risk that a patient will relapse within three years, say, is possible from this data, but not when any relapse will happen.},

@article{Breiman1996b,
abstract = {In bagging, predictors are constructed using bootstrap samples from the training set and then aggregated to form a bagged predictor. Each bootstrap sample leaves out about 37% of the examples. These left-out examples can be used to form accurate estimates of important quantities. For instance, they can be used to give much improved estimates of node probabilities and node error rates in decision trees. Using estimated outputs instead of the observed outputs improves accuracy in regression trees. They can also be used to give nearly optimal estimates of generalization errors for bagged predictors. * Partially supported by NSF Grant 1-444063-21445 Introduction: We assume that there is a training set T= {(y n ,x n), n=1, ... ,N} and a method for constructing a predictor Q(x,T) using the given training set. The output variable y can either be a class label (classification) or numerical (regression). In bagging (Breiman[1996a]) a sequence of training sets T B,1 , ... , T B,K are generated of the same size as T by bootstrap selection from T. Then K predictors are constructed such that the kth predictor Q(x,T k,B) is based on the kth bootstrap training set. It was shown that if these predictors are aggregated--averaging in regression or voting in classification, then the resultant predictor can be considerably more accurate than the original predictor. Accuracy is increased if the prediction method is unstable, i.e. if small changes in the training set or in the parameters used in construction can result in large changes in the resulting predictor. The examples generated in Breiman[1996a] were based on trees and subset selection in regression, but it is known that neural nets are also unstable, as are other well-known prediction methods. Other methods such as nearest neighbors, are stable.},

abstract = {The Support Vector Regression (SVR) model has been broadly used for response prediction. However, few researchers have used SVR for survival analysis. In this study, a new SVR model is proposed and SVR with different kernels and the traditional Cox model are trained. The models are compared based on different performance measures. We also select the best subset of features using three feature selection methods: combination of SVR and statistical tests, univariate feature selection based on concordance index, and recursive feature elimination. The evaluations are performed using available medical datasets and also a Breast Cancer (BC) dataset consisting of 573 patients who visited the Oncology Clinic of Hamadan province in Iran. Results show that, for the BC dataset, survival time can be predicted more accurately by linear SVR than nonlinear SVR. Based on the three feature selection methods, metastasis status, progesterone receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status are the best features associated to survival. Also, according to the obtained results, performance of linear and nonlinear kernels is comparable. The proposed SVR model performs similar to or slightly better than other models. Also, SVR performs similar to or better than Cox when all features are included in model.},

abstract = {The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve is often used to study the diagnostic accuracy of a single continuous biomarker, measured at baseline, on the onset of a disease condition when the disease onset may occur at different times during the follow-up and hence may be right censored. Due to right censoring, the true disease onset status prior to the pre-specified time horizon may be unknown for some patients, which causes difficulty in calculating the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity. We propose to estimate the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity by weighting the censored data by the conditional probability of disease onset prior to the time horizon given the biomarker, the observed time to event, and the censoring indicator, with the weights calculated nonparametrically through a kernel regression on time to event. With this nonparametric weighting adjustment, we derive a novel, closed-form formula to calculate the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve. We demonstrate through numerical study and theoretical arguments that the proposed method is insensitive to misspecification of the kernel bandwidth, produces unbiased and efficient estimators of time-dependent sensitivity and specificity, the area under the curve, and other estimands from the receiver operating characteristic curve, and outperforms several other published methods currently implemented in R packages.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Clinical next-generation sequencing (CNGS) is introducing new opportunities and challenges into the practice of medicine. Simultaneously, these technologies are generating uncertainties of an unprecedented scale that laboratories, clinicians, and patients are required to address and manage. We describe in this report the conceptual design of a new taxonomy of uncertainties around the use of CNGS in health care. METHODS: Interviews to delineate the dimensions of uncertainty in CNGS were conducted with genomics experts and themes were extracted in order to expand on a previously published three-dimensional taxonomy of medical uncertainty. In parallel, we developed an interactive website to disseminate the CNGS taxonomy to researchers and engage them in its continued refinement. RESULTS: The proposed taxonomy divides uncertainty along three axes-source, issue, and locus-and further discriminates the uncertainties into five layers with multiple domains. Using a hypothetical clinical example, we illustrate how the taxonomy can be applied to findings from CNGS and used to guide stakeholders through interpretation and implementation of variant results. CONCLUSION: The utility of the proposed taxonomy lies in promoting consistency in describing dimensions of uncertainty in publications and presentations, to facilitate research design and management of the uncertainties inherent in the implementation of CNGS.Genet Med advance online publication 19 January 2017.},

@article{Uno2011,
abstract = {For modern evidence-based medicine, a well thought-out risk scoring system for predicting the occurrence of a clinical event plays an important role in selecting prevention and treatment strategies. Such an index system is often established based on the subject's 'baseline' genetic or clinical markers via a working parametric or semi-parametric model. To evaluate the adequacy of such a system, C-statistics are routinely used in the medical literature to quantify the capacity of the estimated risk score in discriminating among subjects with different event times. The C-statistic provides a global assessment of a fitted survival model for the continuous event time rather than focussing on the prediction of bit-year survival for a fixed time. When the event time is possibly censored, however, the population parameters corresponding to the commonly used C-statistics may depend on the study-specific censoring distribution. In this article, we present a simple C-statistic without this shortcoming. The new procedure consistently estimates a conventional concordance measure which is free of censoring. We provide a large sample approximation to the distribution of this estimator for making inferences about the concordance measure. Results from numerical studies suggest that the new procedure performs well in finite sample.},

abstract = {The statistics profession is at a unique point in history. The need for valid statistical tools is greater than ever; data sets are massive, often measuring hundreds of thousands of measurements for a single subject. The field is ready to move towards clear objective benchmarks under which tools can be evaluated. Targeted learning allows (1) the full generalization and utilization of cross-validation as an estimator selection tool so that the subjective choices made by humans are now made by the machine, and (2) targeting the fitting of the probability distribution of the data toward the target parameter representing the scientific question of interest. This book is aimed at both statisticians and applied researchers interested in causal inference and general effect estimation for observational and experimental data. Part I is an accessible introduction to super learning and the targeted maximum likelihood estimator, including related concepts necessary to understand and apply these methods. Parts II-IX handle complex data structures and topics applied researchers will immediately recognize from their own research, including time-to-event outcomes, direct and indirect effects, positivity violations, case-control studies, censored data, longitudinal data, and genomic studies."Targeted Learning, by Mark J. van der Laan and Sherri Rose, fills a much needed gap in statistical and causal inference. It protects us from wasting computational, analytical, and data resources on irrelevant aspects of a problem and teaches us how to focus on what is relevant answering questions that researchers truly care about."-Judea Pearl, Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles"In summary, this book should be on the shelf of every investigator who conducts observational research and randomized controlled trials. The concepts and methodology are foundational for causal inference and at the same time stay true to what the data at hand can say about the questions that motivate their collection."-Ira B.

abstract = {Some interesting recent studies have shown that neural network models are useful alternatives in modeling survival data when the assumptions of a classical parametric or semiparametric survival model such as the Cox (1972) model are seriously violated. However, to the best of our knowledge, the plausibility of adapting the emerging extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks to survival analysis has not been explored. In this paper, we present a kernel ELM Cox model regularized by an L0-based broken adaptive ridge (BAR) penalization method. Then, we demonstrate that the resulting method, referred to as ELMCoxBAR, can outperform some other state-of-art survival prediction methods such as L1- or L2-regularized Cox regression, random survival forest with various splitting rules, and boosted Cox model, in terms of its predictive performance using both simulated and real world datasets. In addition to its good predictive performance, we illustrate that the proposed method has a key computational advantage over the above competing methods in terms of computation time efficiency using an a real-world ultra?high-dimensional survival data.},

abstract = {Traditional Cox proportional hazard model for survival analysis are based on structured features like patients' sex, smoke years, BMI, etc. With the development of medical imaging technology, more and more unstructured medical images are available for diagnosis, treatment and survival analysis. Traditional survival models utilize these unstructured images by extracting human-designed features from them. However, we argue that those hand-crafted features have limited abilities in representing highly abstract information. In this paper, we for the first time develop a deep convolutional neural network for survival analysis (DeepConvSurv) with pathological images. The deep layers in our model could represent more abstract information compared with hand-crafted features from the images. Hence, it will improve the survival prediction performance. From our extensive experiments on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) lung cancer data, we show that the proposed DeepConvSurv model improves significantly compared with four state-of-the-art methods.},

This contribution reviews the state-of-the-art in spatial and spatiotemporal cross-validation, and introduces the {R} package {mlr3spatiotempcv} as an extension package of the machine-learning framework {mlr3}. Currently various {R} packages implementing different spatiotemporal partitioning strategies exist: {blockCV}, {CAST}, {skmeans} and {sperrorest}. The goal of {mlr3spatiotempcv} is to gather the available spatiotemporal resampling methods in {R} and make them available to users through a simple and common interface. This is made possible by integrating the package directly into the {mlr3} machine-learning framework, which already has support for generic non-spatiotemporal resampling methods such as random partitioning. One advantage is the use of a consistent nomenclature in an overarching machine-learning toolkit instead of a varying package-specific syntax, making it easier for users to choose from a variety of spatiotemporal resampling methods. This package avoids giving recommendations which method to use in practice as this decision depends on the predictive task at hand, the autocorrelation within the data, and the spatial structure of the sampling design or geographic objects being studied.},

abstract = {Abstract Often the effect of at least one of the prognostic factors in a Cox regression model changes over time, which violates the proportional hazards assumption of this model. As a consequence, the average hazard ratio for such a prognostic factor is under- or overestimated. While there are several methods to appropriately cope with non-proportional hazards, in particular by including parameters for time-dependent effects, weighted estimation in Cox regression is a parsimonious alternative without additional parameters. The methodology, which extends the weighted k-sample logrank tests of the Tarone-Ware scheme to models with multiple, binary and continuous covariates, has been introduced in the nineties of the last century and is further developed and re-evaluated in this contribution. The notion of an average hazard ratio is defined and its connection to the effect size measure P(X<Y) is emphasized. The suggested approach accomplishes estimation of intuitively interpretable average hazard ratios and provides tools for inference. A Monte Carlo study confirms the satisfactory performance. Advantages of the approach are exemplified by comparing standard and weighted analyses of an international lung cancer study. SAS and R programs facilitate application.

abstract = {The proportional hazards (PH) model is routinely employed for the analysis of time-to-event data in medical research when it is required to assess the effect of an intervention in the presence of covariates. The assumption of PH required for the PH approach may not hold, especially in circumstances where the effect of the intervention is to delay or accelerate the onset of an event rather than to reduce or increase the overall proportion of subjects who observe the event through time. If the assumption of PH is violated, the results from a PH model will be difficult to generalize to situations where the length of follow-up is different to that used in the analysis. It is also difficult to translate the results into the effect upon the expected median duration of illness for a patient in a clinical setting. The accelerated failure time (AFT) approach is an alternative strategy for the analysis of time-to-event data and can be suitable even when hazards are not proportional and this family of models contains a certain form of PH as a special case. The framework can allow for different forms of the hazard function and may provide a closer description of the data in certain circumstances. In addition, the results of the AFT model may be easier to interpret and more relevant to clinicians, as they can be directly translated into expected reduction or prolongation of the median time to event, unlike the hazard ratio. We recommend that consideration is given to an AFT modelling approach in the analysis of time-to-event data in medical research.},

abstract = {Uncertainty is a pervasive and important problem that has attracted increasing attention in health care, given the growing emphasis on evidence-based medicine, shared decision making, and patient-centered care. However, our understanding of this problem is limited, in part because of the absence of a unified, coherent concept of uncertainty. There are multiple meanings and varieties of uncertainty in health care that are not often distinguished or acknowledged although each may have unique effects or warrant different courses of action. The literature on uncertainty in health care is thus fragmented, and existing insights have been incompletely translated to clinical practice. This article addresses this problem by synthesizing diverse theoretical and empirical literature from the fields of communication, decision science, engineering, health services research, and psychology and developing a new integrative conceptual taxonomy of uncertainty. A 3-dimensional taxonomy is proposed that characterizes uncertainty in health care according to its fundamental sources, issues, and locus. It is shown how this new taxonomy facilitates an organized approach to the problem of uncertainty in health care by clarifying its nature and prognosis and suggesting appropriate strategies for its analysis and management.},

abstract = {<p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Gamma variant of concern has spread rapidly across Brazil since late 2020, causing substantial infection and death waves. Here we used individual-level patient records after hospitalization with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 20 January 2020 and 26 July 2021 to document temporary, sweeping shocks in hospital fatality rates that followed the spread of Gamma across 14 state capitals, during which typically more than half of hospitalized patients aged 70 years and older died. We show that such extensive shocks in COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rates also existed before the detection of Gamma. Using a Bayesian fatality rate model, we found that the geographic and temporal fluctuations in Brazil's COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rates were primarily associated with geographic inequities and shortages in healthcare capacity. We estimate that approximately half of the COVID-19 deaths in hospitals in the 14 cities could have been avoided without pre-pandemic geographic inequities and without pandemic healthcare pressure. Our results suggest that investments in healthcare resources, healthcare optimization and pandemic preparedness are critical to minimize population-wide mortality and morbidity caused by highly transmissible and deadly pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, especially in low- and middle-income countries.</p>},

abstract = {In this report, we summarise the findings of our evaluation of the easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as set out in the UK Government's Roadmap out of Lockdown focusing on the potential impact of B.1.617.2. Full methods, data used, and parameter values assumed for forward projections are given in the technical appendix. Key parameters relevant to interpretation of findings are provided in the text. Results and assumptions refer to England unless otherwise specified. 1. We estimate the current level of transmission, R eff , is approximately 0.8 for B.1.1.7 and 1.5 for B.1.617.2 in England, with an overall R eff of $\sim$1.4 across both variants. This may not capture all changes in transmissibility since the 17 May reopening as R is a lagging indicator by 3 weeks. 2. Based on Public Health England (PHE) data available to 1 June 2021, 74% of the adult population in England have received at least one vaccine dose and 50% have received two doses. 3. Across all transmissibility and immune escape scenarios explored, we estimate that B.1.617.2 could lead to a significant third wave of hospitalisations and deaths similar to or larger than the winter wave. 4. Cases, hospitalisations, and deaths in the next month could grow rapidly. Large uncertainty remains regarding the scale of the future epidemic and resulting additional burden. 5. Delaying step 4 releases beyond 21 June should delay the projected third wave and reduce the estimated number of hospitalisation and deaths. This will also allow more time for alternative control strategies such as boosters doses and vaccination of <18 years to be considered and implemented. 6. In the range of parameters we examined, immune escape properties of B.1.617.2 affected the magnitude of the third wave more than assumptions about transmissibility. However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the levels of transmissibility and immune escape of B.1.617.2 which translate into large uncertainty on the possible future epidemic trajectory. 7. Global collaborative efforts to control transmission abroad will be vital in preventing further emergence and importation of new VOCs which may trigger another wave and necessitate further reconsideration or reversal of the current roadmap. VOC importations over time should also be monitored carefully. Careful testing and quarantine measures will be critical as international travel restrictions are lifted. 8. Given the many uncertainties involved in making these projections and in light of the increasing B.1.617.2 cases in England, more time may be needed to fully assess the impact of Step 3 and better characterise the transmissibility, severity, and immune escape properties of B.1.617.2 before committing to Step 4 which will pose the greatest risk to increased transmission.},

abstract = {Background: Gastric cancer is the one of the most prevalent reason of\ncancer-related death in the world. Survival of patients after surgery\ninvolves identifying risk factors. There are various models to detect\nthe effect of risk factors on patients' survival. The present study aims\nat evaluating these models.\nMethods: Data from 330 gastric cancer patients diagnosed at the Iran\ncancer institute during 1995-99 and followed up the end of 2011 were\nanalyzed. The survival status of these patients in 2011 was determined\nby reopening the files as well as phone calls and the effect of various\nfactors such as demographic, clinical, treatment, and post-surgical on\npatients' survival was studied. To compare various models of survival,\nAkaike Information Criterion and Cox-Snell Residuals were used. STATA 11\nwas used for data analyses.\nResults: Based on Cox-Snell Residuals and Akaike Information Criterion,\nthe exponential (AIC=969.14) and Gompertz (AIC=970.70) models were more\nefficient than other accelerated failure-time models. Results of Cox\nproportional hazard model as well as the analysis of accelerated\nfailure-time models showed that variables such as age (at diagnosis),\nmarital status, relapse, number of supplementary treatments, disease\nstage, and type of surgery were among factors affecting survival\n(P<0.05).\nConclusion: Although most cancer researchers tend to use proportional\nhazard model, accelerated failure-time models in analogous conditions -\nas they do not require proportional hazards assumption and consider a\nparametric statistical distribution for survival time-will be credible\nalternatives to proportional hazard model.},

abstract = {Background: The widespread availability of new computational methods and tools for data analysis and predictive modeling requires medical informatics researchers and practitioners to systematically select the most appropriate strategy to cope with clinical prediction problems. In particular, the collection of methods known as 'data mining' offers methodological and technical solutions to deal with the analysis of medical data and construction of prediction models. A large variety of these methods requires general and simple guidelines that may help practitioners in the appropriate selection of data mining tools, construction and validation of predictive models, along with the dissemination of predictive models within clinical environments. Purpose: The goal of this review is to discuss the extent and role of the research area of predictive data mining and to propose a framework to cope with the problems of constructing, assessing and exploiting data mining models in clinical medicine. Methods: We review the recent relevant work published in the area of predictive data mining in clinical medicine, highlighting critical issues and summarizing the approaches in a set of learned lessons. Results: The paper provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art of predictive data mining in clinical medicine and gives guidelines to carry out data mining studies in this field. Conclusions: Predictive data mining is becoming an essential instrument for researchers and clinical practitioners in medicine. Understanding the main issues underlying these methods and the application of agreed and standardized procedures is mandatory for their deployment and the dissemination of results. Thanks to the integration of molecular and clinical data taking place within genomic medicine, the area has recently not only gained a fresh impulse but also a new set of complex problems it needs to address. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As well as clarifying relationships between generative and discriminative views of learning, the new machinery leads to tight and more general surrogate loss bounds and generalised Pinsker inequalities relating f-divergences to variational divergence. The new viewpoint illuminates existing algorithms: it provides a new derivation of Support Vector Machines in terms of divergences and relates Maximum Mean Discrepancy to Fisher Linear Discriminants. It also suggests new techniques for estimating f-divergences.},

abstract = {Objective: There are a number of models for determining risk factors for survival of patients with gastric cancer. This study was conducted to select the model showing the best fit with available data. Methods: Cox regression and parametric models (Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, Log normal, Log logistic and Generalized Gamma) were utilized in unadjusted and adjusted forms to detect factors influencing mortality of patients. Comparisons were made with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) by using STATA 13 and R 3.1.3 softwares. Results: The results of this study indicated that all parametric models outperform the Cox regression model. The Log normal, Log logistic and Generalized Gamma provided the best performance in terms of AIC values (179.2, 179.4 and 181.1, respectively). On unadjusted analysis, the results of the Cox regression and parametric models indicated stage, grade, largest diameter of metastatic nest, largest diameter of LM, number of involved lymph nodes and the largest ratio of metastatic nests to lymph nodes, to be variables influencing the survival of patients with gastric cancer. On adjusted analysis, according to the best model (log normal), grade was found as the significant variable. Conclusion: The results suggested that all parametric models outperform the Cox model. The log normal model provides the best fit and is a good substitute for Cox regression.},

Gr{\o}nnesby and Borgan developed a test under the proportional hazards assumption, and Nam and D'Agostino developed a nonparametric test that is applicable in a more general survival setting for data with limited censoring. We analyze the performance of the two tests and show that the Gr{\o}nnesby-Borgan test attains appropriate size in a variety of settings, whereas the Nam-D'Agostino method has a higher than nominal Type 1 error when there is more than trivial censoring. Both tests are sensitive to small cell sizes. We develop a modification of the Nam-D'Agostino test to allow for higher censoring rates. We show that this modified Nam-D'Agostino test has appropriate control of Type 1 error and comparable power to the Gr{\o}nnesby-Borgan test and is applicable to settings other than proportional hazards. We also discuss the application to small cell sizes.},

abstract = {Measures of predictive ability play an important role in quantifying the clinical significance of prognostic factors. Several measures have been proposed to evaluate the predictive ability of survival models in the last two decades, but no single measure is consistently used. The proposed measures can be classified into the following categories: explained variation, explained randomness, and predictive accuracy. The three categories are conceptually different and are based on different principles. Several new measures have been proposed since Schemper and Stare's study in 1996 on some of the existing measures. This paper is the first of two papers that study the proposed measures systematically by applying a set of criteria that a measure of predictive ability should possess in the context of survival analysis. The present paper focuses on the explained variation category, and part II studies the proposed measures in the other categories. Simulation studies are used to examine the performance of five explained variation measures with respect to these criteria, discussing their strengths and shortcomings. Our simulation studies show that the measures proposed by Kent and O'Quigley, R, and Royston and Sauerbrei, R, appear to be the best overall at quantifying predictive ability. However, it should be noted that neither measure is perfect; R is sensitive to outliers and R to (marked) non-normality of the distribution of the prognostic index. The results show that the other measures perform poorly, primarily because they are adversely affected by censoring. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Neural networks have received considerable attention recently, mostly by non-statisticians. They are considered by many to be very promising tools for classification and prediction. In this paper we present an approach to modelling censored survival data using the input-output relationship associated with a simple feed-forward neural network as the basis for a non-linear proportional hazards model. This approach can be extended to other models used with censored survival data. The proportional hazards neural network parameters are estimated using the method of maximum likelihood. These maximum likelihood based models can be compared, using readily available techniques such as the likelihood ratio test and the Akaike criterion. The neural network models are illustrated using data on the survival of men with prostatic carcinoma. A method of interpreting the neural network predictions based on the factorial contrasts is presented.},

abstract = {Regression models such as the Cox proportional hazards model have had increasing  use in modelling and estimating the prognosis of patients with a variety of diseases. Many applications involve a large number of variables to be modelled using a relatively small patient sample. Problems of overfitting and of identifying important covariates are exacerbated in analysing prognosis because the accuracy of a model is more a function of the number of events than of the sample size. We used a general index of predictive discrimination to measure the ability of a model developed on training samples of varying sizes to predict survival in an independent test sample of patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. We compared three methods of model fitting: (1) standard 'step-up' variable selection, (2) incomplete principal components regression, and (3) Cox model regression after developing clinical indices from variable clusters. We found regression using principal components to offer superior predictions in the test sample, whereas regression using indices offers easily interpretable models nearly as good as the principal components models. Standard variable selection has a number of deficiencies.},

abstract = {Summary Background England's COVID-19 roadmap out of lockdown policy set out the timeline and conditions for the stepwise lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as vaccination roll-out continued, with step one starting on March 8, 2021. In this study, we assess the roadmap, the impact of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2, and potential future epidemic trajectories. Methods This mathematical modelling study was done to assess the UK Government's four-step process to easing lockdown restrictions in England, UK. We extended a previously described model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to incorporate vaccination and multi-strain dynamics to explicitly capture the emergence of the delta variant. We calibrated the model to English surveillance data, including hospital admissions, hospital occupancy, seroprevalence data, and population-level PCR testing data using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework, then modelled the potential trajectory of the epidemic for a range of different schedules for relaxing NPIs. We estimated the resulting number of daily infections and hospital admissions, and daily and cumulative deaths. Three scenarios spanning a range of optimistic to pessimistic vaccine effectiveness, waning natural immunity, and cross-protection from previous infections were investigated. We also considered three levels of mixing after the lifting of restrictions. Findings The roadmap policy was successful in offsetting the increased transmission resulting from lifting NPIs starting on March 8, 2021, with increasing population immunity through vaccination. However, because of the emergence of the delta variant, with an estimated transmission advantage of 76% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 69–83) over alpha, fully lifting NPIs on June 21, 2021, as originally planned might have led to 3900 (95% CrI 1500–5700) peak daily hospital admissions under our central parameter scenario. Delaying until July 19, 2021, reduced peak hospital admissions by three fold to 1400 (95% CrI 700–1700) per day. There was substantial uncertainty in the epidemic trajectory, with particular sensitivity to the transmissibility of delta, level of mixing, and estimates of vaccine effectiveness. Interpretation Our findings show that the risk of a large wave of COVID-19 hospital admissions resulting from lifting NPIs can be substantially mitigated if the timing of NPI relaxation is carefully balanced against vaccination coverage. However, with the delta variant, it might not be possible to fully lift NPIs without a third wave of hospital admissions and deaths, even if vaccination coverage is high. Variants of concern, their transmissibility, vaccine uptake, and vaccine effectiveness must be carefully monitored as countries relax pandemic control measures.

The review identified four models for identifying people at risk in the general population; 91 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (60 were based on medical imaging, nine to diagnose disease severity); and 50 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, intensive care unit admission, ventilation, intubation, or length of hospital stay. The most frequently reported predictors of diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 are age, body temperature, lymphocyte count, and lung imaging features. Flu-like symptoms and neutrophil count are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while comorbidities, sex, C reactive protein, and creatinine are frequent prognostic factors. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.68 to 0.99 in prognostic models. All models were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting. Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed.Conclusion Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models for use in current practice. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones. The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.Systematic review registration Protocol https://osf.io/ehc47/, registration https://osf.io/wy245.Readers' note This article is a living systematic review that will be updated to reflect emerging evidence.

abstract = {Background Executive dysregulation and impulsivity can both predispose individuals to risk-prone actions. Although the risk of falls is well established in people with poor executive function, its association to impulsivity is less clear. Purpose To describe and assess the prognostic capabilities of the relationship between impulsivity, executive function, functional capability, and falls in the in-patient neurorehabilitation population. Materials and Methods A prospective cohort study in a 26-bed neurorehabilitation unit in London, recruiting 121 patients, of whom 94 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Cognitive-behavioural assessment was undertaken using the short (16-item) version of the Urgency-Premeditation-Perseverance-Sensation Seeking-Positive Urgency (UPPS) impulsive behaviour scale, and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Patients also underwent a functional assessment at admission and discharge using the UK Functional Independence and Assessment Measure tool (FIM + FAM). The main outcome of interest was falling during an in-patient episode, which are routinely recorded in a computerized registry of adverse incidents. Results Measurements of impulsivity (based on the UPPS-Short form) and executive function (based on the Trail Making Test) were not found to be significantly associated with functional improvement, or risk of falling. Predictive modelling experiments demonstrated that neither of the aforementioned results were capable of identifying individuals at risk of falling more accurately than an informed guess. Conclusion Where impulsivity is present, measurement using structured tools such as the UPPS may be informative to guide individualized rehabilitation programmes; however, its usefulness as the basis of risk prediction models for falls is less likely given the results of this study.},

However, parents often want this prognostic information because it underpins informed decision-making, especially near the end of life. In addition, despite understandable clinician concerns about its emotional impact, prognostic disclosure can actually support hope and peace of mind among parents struggling to live with a child's illness. Children, too, may need to understand what is ahead to manage uncertainty and make plans for the ways their remaining life will be lived. In this article, we describe the ethical issues involved in disclosure of prognostic information to parents and children with life-threatening illness and offer practical guidance for these conversations.},

abstract = {Background Quantitative methods for the analysis of prognostic information are important in order to use this knowledge optimally. The neural network is a new quantitative method where the fundamental building blocks are units which can be likened to neurons, and weighted connections which can be likened to synapses. The more the hidden units, the more complex the patterns that can be learnt. Materials and methods Data from two Dutch studies in ovarian cancer were used to compare the previously reported survival rates predicted by the Cox's prognostic index with the prediction obtained by a neural network Results Both the Cox's analysis and the neural network agreed on residual tumour size, stage, and performance status as being important for survival. The neural network identified additional predictive factors such as place of diagnosis and age. As the Cox's prognostic index has not been tested to predict survival on an independent data set a comparison with the results obtained in the neural network test set could not be performed. Conclusions Neural networks perform at least as well as Cox's method for the prediction of survival, and prognostic factors can easily be identified. The analysis not only revealed the predictive power of some characteristics, but also the non-predictive power of the others. },

abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of a neural network in predicting 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival. A series of 951 breast cancer patients was divided into a training set of 651 and a validation set of 300 patients. Eight variables were entered as input to the network: tumor size, axillary nodal status, histological type, mitotic count, nuclear pleomorphism, tubule formation, tumor necrosis and age. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as a measure of accuracy of the prediction models in generating survival estimates for the patients in the independent validation set. The AUC values of the neural network models for 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival were 0.909, 0.886 and 0.883, respectively.The corresponding AUC values for logistic regression were 0.897, 0.862 and 0.858. Axillary lymph node status (N0 vs. N+) predicted 5-year survival with a specificity of 71% and a sensitivity of 77%. The sensitivity of the neural network model was 91% at this specificity level. The rate of false predictions at 5 years was 82/300 for nodal status and 40/300 for the neural network. When nodal status was excluded from the neural network model, the rate of false predictions increased only to 49/300 (AUC 0.877). An artificial neural network is very accurate in the 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival prediction. The consistently high accuracy over time and the good predictive performance of a network trained without information on nodal status demonstrate that neural networks can be important tools for cancer survival prediction.},

This is a non-trivial problem as discrimination measures are the most commonly used in survival analysis and yet there is no clear method to derive a risk prediction from a distribution prediction. We survey methods proposed in literature and software and consider their respective advantages and disadvantages. Whilst distributions are frequently evaluated by discrimination measures, we find that the method for doing so is rarely described in the literature and often leads to unfair comparisons. We find that the most robust method of reducing a distribution to a risk is to sum over the predicted cumulative hazard. We recommend that machine learning survival analysis software implements clear transformations between distribution and risk predictions in order to allow more transparent and accessible model evaluation.

abstract = {Abstract Survival prediction from high-dimensional genomic data is dependent on a proper regularization method. With an increasing number of such methods proposed in the literature, comparative studies are called for and some have been performed. However, there is currently no consensus on which prediction assessment criterion should be used for time-to-event data. Without a firm knowledge about whether the choice of evaluation criterion may affect the conclusions made as to which regularization method performs best, these comparative studies may be of limited value. In this paper, four evaluation criteria are investigated: the log-rank test for two groups, the area under the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC), an R2-measure based on the Cox partial likelihood, and an R2-measure based on the Brier score. The criteria are compared according to how they rank six widely used regularization methods that are based on the Cox regression model, namely univariate selection, principal components regression (PCR), supervised PCR, partial least squares regression, ridge regression, and the lasso. Based on our application to three microarray gene expression data sets, we find that the results obtained from the widely used log-rank test deviate from the other three criteria studied. For future studies, where one also might want to include non-likelihood or non-model-based regularization methods, we argue in favor of AUC and the R2-measure based on the Brier score, as these do not suffer from the arbitrary splitting into two groups nor depend on the Cox partial likelihood.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In 1984, the German Breast Cancer Study Group started a multicenter randomized trial to compare six versus three cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) starting perioperatively and to investigate the additional effect of tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment in node-positive breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1984 to 1989, 473 patients were randomized from 41 institutions. After a median follow-up of approximately 10 years for overall survival (OS) and 9 years for event-free survival (EFS), the treatment groups were compared with respect to OS and EFS. Results based on a median follow-up of 56 months have been published earlier. RESULTS: Estimated cumulative locoregional incidence rate after 10 years was 19.9%; the corresponding rate of distant recurrences was 41.3%. Concerning duration of chemotherapy, we did not find any difference between six and three cycles of CMF (EFS: relative risk [RR] in multivariate analysis = 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.21 OS: RR = 0.90; 95% CI, = 0.69 to 1.18). Treatment with tamoxifen resulted in an improvement in outcome (EFS: RR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.07, OS: RR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.0) although it proved not significant. Number of positive lymph nodes and progesterone receptor were the dominant prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed some tendency in favor of hormonal treatment, which is in agreement with the literature. Concerning duration of chemotherapy, the results of this study provide further evidence that a reduction to three cycles of CMF is possible without increasing the risk of recurrence or death. For a definitive conclusion, however, further investigations are required.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis is well established for assessing how well a marker is capable of discriminating between individuals who experience disease onset and individuals who do not. The classical (standard) approach of ROC curve analysis considers event (disease) status and marker value for an individual as fixed over time, however in practice, both the disease status and marker value change over time. Individuals who are disease-free earlier may develop the disease later due to longer study follow-up, and also their marker value may change from baseline during follow-up. Thus, an ROC curve as a function of time is more appropriate. However, many researchers still use the standard ROC curve approach to determine the marker capability ignoring the time dependency of the disease status or the marker. METHODS We comprehensively review currently proposed methodologies of time-dependent ROC curves which use single or longitudinal marker measurements, aiming to provide clarity in each methodology, identify software tools to carry out such analysis in practice and illustrate several applications of the methodology. We have also extended some methods to incorporate a longitudinal marker and illustrated the methodologies using a sequential dataset from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver. RESULTS From our methodological review, we have identified 18 estimation methods of time-dependent ROC curve analyses for censored event times and three other methods can only deal with non-censored event times. Despite the considerable numbers of estimation methods, applications of the methodology in clinical studies are still lacking. CONCLUSIONS The value of time-dependent ROC curve methods has been re-established. We have illustrated the methods in practice using currently available software and made some recommendations for future research.},

Explained variation measures the relative gains in predictive accuracy when prediction based on covariates replaces unconditional prediction.

The measures are given both in a model-based formulation and in a formulation directly contrasting observed and expected outcomes. Various aspects of application are demonstrated by examples from three forms of regression models. It is emphasized that the likely degree of absolute or relative predictive accuracy often is low even if there are highly significant and relatively strong covariates.

In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic.

As opposed to the standard\nclassification and regression problems where a domain expert can provide\nlabels for the data in a reasonably short period of time, training data\nin such longitudinal studies must be obtained only by waiting for the\noccurrence of a sufficient number of events. Survival analysis aims at\ndirectly predicting the time to an event of interest using the data\ncollected in the past for a certain duration. However, it cannot give an\nanswer to the open question of ``how to forecast whether a subject will\nexperience an event by end of a longitudinal study using event\noccurrence information of other subjects at the early stage of the\nstudy?{''}. The goal of this work is to predict the event occurrence at\na future time point using only the information about a limited number of\nevents that occurred at the initial stages of a longitudinal study. This\nproblem exhibits two major challenges: (1) absence of complete\ninformation about event occurrence (censoring) and (2) availability of\nonly a partial set of events that occurred during the initial phase of\nthe study. We propose a novel Early Stage Prediction (ESP) framework for\nbuilding event prediction models which are trained at the early stages\nof longitudinal studies. First, we develop a novel approach to address\nthe first challenge by introducing a new method for handling censored\ndata using Kaplan-Meier estimator. We then extend the Naive Bayes,\nTree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), and Bayesian Network methods based on\nthe proposed framework, and develop three algorithms, namely, ESP-NB,\nESP-TAN, and ESPBN, to effectively predict event occurrence using\ntraining data obtained at an early stage of the study. More\nspecifically, our approach effectively integrates Bayesian methods with\nan Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model by adapting the prior\nprobability of the event occurrence for future time points. The proposed\nframework is evaluated using a wide range of synthetic and real-world\nbenchmark datasets. Our extensive set of experiments show that the\nproposed ESP framework is, on an average, 20 percent more accurate\ncompared to existing schemes when using only limited event information\nin the training data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was developed to determine whether descriptive information from a patient-completed questionnaire could provide prognostic information that was independent from that already obtained by the patient's physician. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An initial detailed questionnaire was administered to approximately 150 patients with advanced cancer. This questionnaire was subsequently revised and given to a total of 1,115 patients with advanced colorectal or lung cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the data from these questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 36 variables showed statistically significant prognostic information for survival in univariate analyses, even though many of these variables were associated with only a minimal increase in risk. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was a high correlation between many variables. Three major groups of variables became apparent as providing strong prognostic information. These included the following: (1) a physician's assessment of performance status (PS); (2) a patient's assessment of their own PS; and (3) a nutritional factor such as appetite, caloric intake, or overall food intake. CONCLUSION: Data generated by a patient-completed questionnaire can provide important prognostic information independent from that obtained by other physician-determined prognostic factors.},

abstract = {[The performance of clinical tests for disease screening is often evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Recent developments have extended the traditional setting to the AUC with binary time-varying failure status. Without considering covariates, our first theme is to propose a simple and easily computed nonparametric estimator for the time-dependent AUC. Moreover, we use generalized linear models with time-varying coefficients to characterize the time-dependent AUC as a function of covariate values. The corresponding estimation procedures are proposed to estimate the parameter functions of interest. The derived limiting Gaussian processes and the estimated asymptotic variances enable us to construct the approximated confidence regions for the AUCs. The finite sample properties of our proposed estimators and inference procedures are examined through extensive simulations. An analysis of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 data is further presented to show the applicability of the proposed methods.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare machine learning (ML) methods with conventional statistical methods to investigate the predictive ability of carotid plaque characteristics for assessing the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiovascular (CV) events. Focused carotid B-mode ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and coronary angiography were performed on 459 participants. These participants were followed for 30 days. Plaque characteristics such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), maximum plaque height (MPH), total plaque area (TPA), and intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) were measured at baseline. Two ML-based algorithms—random forest (RF) and random survival forest (RSF) were used for CAD and CV event prediction. The performance of these algorithms was compared against (i) univariate and multivariate analysis for CAD prediction using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) and (ii) Cox proportional hazard model for CV event prediction using the concordance index (c-index). There was a significant association between CAD and carotid plaque characteristics [cIMT (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, p = 0.03), MPH (OR = 2.44, p < 0.0001), TPA (OR = 1.61, p < 0.0001), and IPN (OR = 2.78, p < 0.0001)]. IPN alone reported significant CV event prediction (hazard ratio = 1.24, p < 0.0001). CAD prediction using the RF algorithm reported an improvement in AUC by $\sim$ 3% over the univariate analysis with IPN alone (0.97 vs. 0.94, p < 0.0001). Cardiovascular event prediction using RSF demonstrated an improvement in the c-index by $\sim$ 17.8% over the Cox-based model (0.86 vs. 0.73). Carotid imaging phenotypes and IPN were associated with CAD and CV events. The ML-based system is superior to the conventional statistically-derived approaches for CAD prediction and survival analysis.},

abstract = {Survival analysis focuses on modeling and predicting the time to an event of interest. Many statistical models have been proposed for survival analysis. They often impose strong assumptions on hazard functions, which describe how the risk of an event changes over time depending on covariates associated with each individual. In particular, the prevalent proportional hazards model assumes that covariates are multiplicatively related to the hazard. Here we propose a nonparametric model for survival analysis that does not explicitly assume particular forms of hazard functions. Our nonparametric model utilizes an ensemble of regression trees to determine how the hazard function varies according to the associated covariates. The ensemble model is trained using a gradient boosting method to optimize a smoothed approximation of the concordance index, which is one of the most widely used metrics in survival model performance evaluation. We implemented our model in a software package called GBMCI (gradient boosting machine for concordance index) and benchmarked the performance of our model against other popular survival models with a large-scale breast cancer prognosis dataset. Our experiment shows that GBMCI consistently outperforms other methods based on a number of covariate settings. GBMCI is implemented in R and is freely available online.},

@article{Chambers2014,
abstract = {This paper reviews some programming techniques in R that have proved useful, particularly for substantial projects. These include several versions of object-oriented programming, used in a large number of R packages. The review tries to clarify the origins and ideas behind the various versions, each of which is valuable in the appropriate context. R has also been strongly influenced by the ideas of functional programming and, in particular, by the desire to combine functional with object oriented programming. To clarify how this particular mix of ideas has turned out in the current R language and supporting software, the paper will first review the basic ideas behind object-oriented and functional programming, and then examine the evolution of R with these ideas providing context. Functional programming supports well-defined, defensible software giving reproducible results. Object-oriented programming is the mechanism par excellence for managing complexity while keeping things simple for the user. The two paradigms have been valuable in supporting major software for fitting models to data and numerous other statistical applications. The paradigms have been adopted, and adapted, distinctively in R. Functional programming motivates much of R but R does not enforce the paradigm. Object-oriented programming from a functional perspective differs from that used in non-functional languages, a distinction that needs to be emphasized to avoid confusion. R initially replicated the S language from Bell Labs, which in turn was strongly influenced by earlier program libraries. At each stage, new ideas have been added, but the previous software continues to show its influence in the design as well. Outlining the evolution will further clarify why we currently have this somewhat unusual combination of ideas.},

abstract = {When developing a prediction model for survival data it is essential to validate its performance in external validation settings using appropriate performance measures. Although a number of such measures have been proposed, there is only limited guidance regarding their use in the context of model validation. This paper reviewed and evaluated a wide range of performance measures to provide some guidelines for their use in practice. An extensive simulation study based on two clinical datasets was conducted to investigate the performance of the measures in external validation settings. Measures were selected from categories that assess the overall performance, discrimination and calibration of a survival prediction model. Some of these have been modified to allow their use with validation data, and a case study is provided to describe how these measures can be estimated in practice. The measures were evaluated with respect to their robustness to censoring and ease of interpretation. All measures are implemented, or are straightforward to implement, in statistical software. Most of the performance measures were reasonably robust to moderate levels of censoring. One exception was Harrell's concordance measure which tended to increase as censoring increased. We recommend that Uno's concordance measure is used to quantify concordance when there are moderate levels of censoring. Alternatively, G{\"{o}}nen and Heller's measure could be considered, especially if censoring is very high, but we suggest that the prediction model is re-calibrated first. We also recommend that Royston's D is routinely reported to assess discrimination since it has an appealing interpretation. The calibration slope is useful for both internal and external validation settings and recommended to report routinely. Our recommendation would be to use any of the predictive accuracy measures and provide the corresponding predictive accuracy curves. In addition, we recommend to investigate the characteristics of the validation data such as the level of censoring and the distribution of the prognostic index derived in the validation setting before choosing the performance measures.},
annote = {Out of all the measures assessed, are there any that can/should be used to compare multiple Survival models (not necessarily Cox). e.g. is it meaningful to compare Uno's C or Gonen and Heller's between models to find the 'best' model. In this case does it still make sense to use the prognostic index in the function if the index is coming from a Weibull model vs Cox model? Is the interpretation the same...

Are there equivalents for AFTs that can be compared to PHs? Or is concordance index always the best and therefore the one measure that should be used?

Do we care at all about distance measures such as brier or logloss that instead compare the true time to event to the predicted time to event? As opposed to comparing the concordance of the linear predictor to the even time},

abstract = {In the context of chronic diseases, patient's health evolution is often evaluated through the study of longitudinal markers and major clinical events such as relapses or death. Dynamic predictions of such types of events may be useful to improve patients management all along their follow-up. Dynamic predictions consist of predictions that are based on information repeatedly collected over time, such as measurements of a biomarker, and that can be updated as soon as new information becomes available. Several techniques to derive dynamic predictions have already been suggested, and computation of dynamic predictions is becoming increasingly popular. In this work, we focus on assessing predictive accuracy of dynamic predictions and suggest that using an R2-curve may help. It facilitates the evaluation of the predictive accuracy gain obtained when accumulating information on a patient's health profile over time. A nonparametric inverse probability of censoring weighted estimator is suggested to deal with censoring. Large sample results are provided, and methods to compute confidence intervals and bands are derived. A simulation study assesses the finite sample size behavior of the inference procedures and illustrates the shape of some R2-curves which can be expected in common settings.

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was conducted in 180 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) to define the efficacy and safety of UDCA. Efficacy was assessed by time to treatment failure defined as death; liver transplantation; histological progression; development of varices, ascites, or encephalopathy; doubling of total serum bilirubin levels; progression of fatigue or pruritus; drug toxicity; or voluntary withdrawal. METHODS: Patients with well-defined PBC underwent complete history, physical examination, liver chemistries, ultrasonography, upper endoscopy, and liver biopsy at entry as well as at 2 years. Liver chemistries were determined every 3 months. RESULTS: In patients receiving UDCA, treatment failure was delayed compared with the placebo-treated group (P = 0.0003, log rank test). Seven patients receiving UDCA died or required transplantation compared with 12 in the placebo group (P = 0.18). No patients discontinued UDCA because of side effects of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: UDCA was extraordinarily safe and well tolerated, and its use was associated with delayed progression of the disease as defined in this study. However, the lack of effects on symptoms, histology, and the need for liver transplantation or survival indicate that further evaluation is necessary to determine the ultimate role of UDCA in the treatment of PBC.},

abstract = {Modeling survival of populations and establishing prognoses for individual patients are important activities in the practice of medicine. For patients with diseases that may extend for several years, in particular, accurate assessment of survival probabilities is essential. New methods, such as neural networks, have been used increasingly to model disease progression. Their advantages and disadvantages, when compared to statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazards, have seldom been explored in real-world data. In this study, we compare the performances of a Cox model and a neural network model that are used as prognostic tools for a set of people living with AIDS. We modeled disease progression for patients who had AIDS (according to the 1993 CDC definition) in a set of 588 patients in California, using data from the ATHOS project. We divided the study population into 10 training and 10 test sets and evaluated the prognostic accuracy of a Cox proportional hazards model and of a neural network model by determining sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values for an arbitrary threshold (0.5). and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (RGC) curves that utilized all possible thresholds for intervals of 1 yr following the diagnosis of AIDS. There was no evidence that tbe Cox model performed better than did the neural network model or vice versa, but the former method had the advantage of providing some insight on which variables were most influential for prognosis. Nevertheless, it is likely that the assumptions required by the Cox model may not be satisfied in all data sets, justifying the use of neural networks in certain cases.},

With the re-gaining popularity of artificial neural networks, we asked if a refined neural network model could be used to predict patient survival, as an alternative to the conventional methods, such as Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH) methods with LASSO or ridge penalization. To this end, we have developed a neural network extension of the Cox regression model, called Cox-nnet. It is optimized for survival prediction from high throughput gene expression data, with comparable or better performance than other conventional methods. More importantly, Cox-nnet reveals much richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels, by analyzing features represented in the hidden layer nodes in Cox-nnet. Additionally, we propose to use hidden node features as a new approach for dimension reduction during survival data analysis.},

This paper focuses on the Kaplan–Meier method, the most popular method used for survival analysis. It makes it possible to calculate the incidence rate of events like recovery of renal function, myocardial infarction or death by using information from all subjects at risk for these events. It explains how the method works, how survival probabilities are calculated, survival data can be summarized and survival in groups can be compared using the logrank test for hypothesis testing. In addition, it provides some guidance regarding the presentation of survival plots. Finally, it discusses the limitations of the Kaplan–Meier method and refers to other methods that better serve additional purposes.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

However, despite their universal success, the key design principles in their construction have never been fully analyzed. In this paper, we attempt to provide an overview of key patterns in the design of AI modeling toolboxes, taking inspiration, in equal parts, from the field of software engineering, implementation patterns found in contemporary toolboxes, and our own experience from developing ML toolboxes. In particular, we develop a conceptual model for the AI/ML domain, with a new type system, called scientific types, at its core. Scientific types capture the scientific meaning of common elements in ML workflows based on the set of operations that we usually perform with them (i.e. their interface) and their statistical properties. From our conceptual analysis, we derive a set of design principles and patterns. We illustrate that our analysis can not only explain the design of existing toolboxes, but also guide the development of new ones. We intend our contribution to be a state-of-art reference for future toolbox engineers, a summary of best practices, a collection of ML design patterns which may become useful for future research, and, potentially, the first steps towards a higher-level programming paradigm for constructing AI.},

The expected loss over some specified set of occasions is called the prediction error. This paper considers the estimation of prediction error when regression models are used to predict survival times and discusses the use of these estimates. Extending the previous work, we consider both point and confidence interval estimations of prediction error, and allow for variable selection and model misspecification. Different estimators are compared in a simulation study for an absolute relative error loss function, and results indicate that cross-validation procedures typically produce reliable point estimates and confidence intervals, whereas model-based estimates are sensitive to model misspecification. Links between performance measures for point predictors and for predictive distributions of survival times are also discussed. The methodology is illustrated in a medical setting involving survival after treatment for disease. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.},

abstract = {Summary. ROC curves are a popular method for displaying sensitivity and specificity of a continuous marker, X, for a binary disease variable, D. However, many disease outcomes are time dependent, D(t, and ROC curves that vary as a function of time may be mire appropriate. A common examples of a time-dependent variable is vital status, where D(t) = 1 if a patient has died prior to time t and zero otherwise. We propose summarizing the discrimination potential of a marker X, measured at baseline (t= 0), by calculating ROC Curves for cumulative disease or death incidence by time t, which we denote as ROC(t). A typical complexity with survival data is that observations may be censored. Two ROC curve estimators are proposed that can accommodate censored data. A simple estimator is based on using the Kaplan-Meier estimated for each possible subset X > c. However, this estimator does not guarantee the necessary condition that sensitivity and specificity are monotone in X. An alternative estimator that does guarantee monotonicity is based on a nearest neighbor estimator for the bivariate distribution function of (X, T), where T represents survival time (Akritas, M. J., 1994, Annals of Statistics22, 1299?1327). We present an example where ROC(t) is used to compare a standard and a modified flow cytometry measurement for predicting survival after detection of breast cancer and an example where the ROC(t) curve displays the impact of modifying eligibility criteria for sample size and power in HIV prevention trials.},

abstract = {Abstract Neural networks are considered by many to be very promising tools for classification and prediction. The flexibility of the neural network models often result in over-fit. Shrinking the parameters using a penalized likelihood is often used in order to overcome such over-fit. In this paper we extend the approach proposed by FARAGGI and SIMON (1995a) to modeling censored survival data using the input-output relationship associated with a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. Instead of estimating the neural network parameters using the method of maximum likelihood, we place normal prior distributions on the parameters and make inferences based on derived posterior distributions of the parameters. This Bayesian formulation will result in shrinking the parameters of the neural network model and will reduce the over-fit compared with the maximum likelihood estimators. We illustrate our proposed method on a simulated and a real example.},

abstract = {Several measures of explained variation have been suggested for the Cox proportional hazards regression model. We have categorized these measures into three classes which correspond to three different definitions of multiple R2 of the general linear model. In an empirical study we compared the performance of these measures and classified them by their adherence to a set of criteria which we think should be met by a measure of explained variation for survival data. We suggest that currently there is no uniformly superior measure, particularly as the concepts of either uncensored or censored populations may lead to different choices. For uncensored populations, a measure by Kent and O'Quigley and the squared rank correlation between survival time and the predictor from a Cox regression model appear recommendable choices. For the latter, censored survival times are terminated using a very recent data augmentation algorithm for multiple imputation under proportional hazards. With censored populations, Schemper's measure, V2, could be considered. We give an introductory example, discuss aspects of application and stress the desirability of routinely evaluating explained variation in studies of survival.},

abstract = {Traditional radiomics models mainly rely on explicitly-designed handcrafted features from medical images. This paper aimed to investigate if deep features extracted via transfer learning can generate radiomics signatures for prediction of overall survival (OS) in patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). This study comprised a discovery data set of 75 patients and an independent validation data set of 37 patients. A total of 1403 handcrafted features and 98304 deep features were extracted from preoperative multi-modality MR images. After feature selection, a six-deep-feature signature was constructed by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. A radiomics nomogram was further presented by combining the signature and clinical risk factors such as age and Karnofsky Performance Score. Compared with traditional risk factors, the proposed signature achieved better performance for prediction of OS (C-index = 0.710, 95% CI: 0.588, 0.932) and significant stratification of patients into prognostically distinct groups (P < 0.001, HR = 5.128, 95% CI: 2.029, 12.960). The combined model achieved improved predictive performance (C-index = 0.739). Our study demonstrates that transfer learning-based deep features are able to generate prognostic imaging signature for OS prediction and patient stratification for GBM, indicating the potential of deep imaging feature-based biomarker in preoperative care of GBM patients.},

For survival data, the statistical methodology to assess such schemes consists mainly of a range of ad hoc approaches, and there is an alarming lack of commonly accepted standards in this "eld. We review these methods and develop measures of inaccuracy which may be calculated in a validation study in order to assess the usefulness of estimated patient-speci"c survival probabilities associated with a prognostic classi"cation scheme. These measures are meaningful even when the estimated probabilities are misspeci"ed, and asymptotically they are not a!ected by random censorship. In addition, they can be used to derive R-type measures of explained residual variation. A breast cancer study will serve for illustration throughout the paper.},

abstract = {Survival analysis (time-to-event analysis) is widely used in economics and finance, engineering, medicine and many other areas. A fundamental problem is to understand the relationship between the covariates and the (distribution of) survival times(times-to-event). Much of the previous work has approached the problem by viewing the survival time as the first hitting time of a stochastic process, assuming a specific form for the underlying stochastic process, using available data to learn the relationship between the covariates and the parameters of the model, and then deducing the relationship between covariates and the distribution of first hitting times (the risk). However, previous models rely on strong parametric assumptions that are often violated. This paper proposes a very different approach to survival analysis, DeepHit, that uses a deep neural network to learn the distribution of survival times directly.DeepHit makes no assumptions about the underlying stochastic process and allows for the possibility that the relationship between covariates and risk(s) changes over time. Most importantly, DeepHit smoothly handles competing risks; i.e. settings in which there is more than one possible event of interest.Comparisons with previous models on the basis of real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DeepHit achieves large and statistically significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular risk prediction functions offer an important diagnostic tool for clinicians and patients themselves. They are usually constructed with the use of parametric or semi-parametric survival regression models. It is essential to be able to evaluate the performance of these models, preferably with summaries that offer natural and intuitive interpretations. The concept of discrimination, popular in the logistic regression context, has been extended to survival analysis. However, the extension is not unique. In this paper, we define discrimination in survival analysis as the model's ability to separate those with longer event-free survival from those with shorter event-free survival within some time horizon of interest. This definition remains consistent with that used in logistic regression, in the sense that it assesses how well the model-based predictions match the observed data. Practical and conceptual examples and numerical simulations are employed to examine four C statistics proposed in the literature to evaluate the performance of survival models. We observe that they differ in the numerical values and aspects of discrimination that they capture. We conclude that the index proposed by Harrell is the most appropriate to capture discrimination described by the above definition. We suggest researchers report which C statistic they are using, provide a rationale for their selection, and be aware that comparing different indices across studies may not be meaningful.},

abstract = {Censoring is a common phenomenon that arises in many longitudinal studies where an event of interest could not be recorded within the given time frame. Censoring causes missing time-to-event labels, and this effect is compounded when dealing with datasets which have high amounts of censored instances. In addition, dependent censoring in the data, where censoring is dependent on the covariates in the data leads to bias in standard survival estimators. This motivates us to develop an approach for pre-processing censored data which calibrates the right censored (RC) times in an attempt to reduce the bias in the survival estimators. This calibration is done using an imputation method which estimates the sparse inverse covariance matrix over the dataset in an iterative convergence framework. During estimation, we apply row and column-based regularization to account for both row and column-wise correlations between different instances while imputing them. This is followed by comparing these imputed censored times with the original RC times to obtain the final calibrated RC times. These calibrated RC times can now be used in the survival dataset in place of the original RC times for more effective prediction. One of the major benefits of our calibration approach is that it is a pre-processing method for censored data which can be used in conjunction with any survival prediction algorithm and improve its performance.We evaluate the goodness of our approach using a wide array of survival prediction algorithms which are applied over crowdfunding data, electronic health records (EHRs), and synthetic censored datasets. Experimental results indicate that our calibration method improves the AUC values of survival prediction algorithms, compared to applying them directly on the original survival data},

abstract = {Studies have documented that traditional motor skills (i.e. motor habits) are part of the cultural way of life that characterises each society. Yet, it is still unclear to what extent motor skills are inherited through culture. Drawing on ethnology and motor behaviour, we addressed this issue through a detailed description of traditional pottery skills. Our goal was to quantify the influence of three kinds of constraints: the transcultural constraints of wheel-throwing, the cultural constraints induced via cultural transmission, and the potters' individual constraints. Five expert Nepalese potters were invited to produce three familiar pottery types, each in five specimens. A total of 31 different fashioning hand positions were identified. Most of them (14) were cross-cultural, ten positions were cultural, five positions were individual, and two positions were unique. Statistical tests indicated that the subset of positions used by the participants in this study were distinct from those of other cultural groups. Behaviours described in terms of fashioning duration, number of gestures, and hand position repertoires size highlighted both individual and cross-cultural traits. We also analysed the time series of the successive hand positions used throughout the fashioning of each vessel. Results showed, for each pottery type, strong reproducible sequences at the individual level and a clearly higher level of variability between potters. Overall, our findings confirm the existence of a cultural transmission in craft skills but also demonstrated that the skill is not fully determined by a cultural marking. We conclude that the influence of culture on craft skills should not be overstated, even if its role is significant given the fact that it reflects the socially transmitted part of the skill. Such research offers insights into archaeological problems in providing a representative view of how cultural constraints influence the motor skills implied in artefact manufacturing.},

Furthermore, we show that a modified version of this estimator is consistent even when censoring and event times are only conditionally independent given the covariates. The modified estimators are derived on the basis of regression models for the censoring distribution. A simulation study and a real data example illustrate the results.

abstract = {In computational science literature including, e.g., bioinformatics, computational statistics or machine learning, most published articles are devoted to the development of “new methods”, while comparison studies are generally appreciated by readers but surprisingly given poor consideration by many journals. This paper stresses the importance of neutral comparison studies for the objective evaluation of existing methods and the establishment of standards by drawing parallels with clinical research. The goal of the paper is twofold. Firstly, we present a survey of recent computational papers on supervised classification published in seven high-ranking computational science journals. The aim is to provide an up-to-date picture of current scientific practice with respect to the comparison of methods in both articles presenting new methods and articles focusing on the comparison study itself. Secondly, based on the results of our survey we critically discuss the necessity, impact and limitations of neutral comparison studies in computational sciences. We define three reasonable criteria a comparison study has to fulfill in order to be considered as neutral, and explicate general considerations on the individual components of a “tidy neutral comparison study”. R codes for completely replicating our statistical analyses and figures are available from the companion website http://www.ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/mitarbeiter/020_professuren/boulesteix/plea2013.},

@article{Kiraly2018d,
abstract = {Objective: To determine the completeness of argumentative steps necessary to conclude effectiveness of an algorithm in a sample of current ML/AI supervised learning literature. Data Sources: Papers published in the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS, n\'ee NIPS) journal where the official record showed a 2017 year of publication. Eligibility Criteria: Studies reporting a (semi-)supervised model, or pre-processing fused with (semi-)supervised models for tabular data. Study Appraisal: Three reviewers applied the assessment criteria to determine argumentative completeness. The criteria were split into three groups, including: experiments (e.g real and/or synthetic data), baselines (e.g uninformed and/or state-of-art) and quantitative comparison (e.g. performance quantifiers with confidence intervals and formal comparison of the algorithm against baselines). Results: Of the 121 eligible manuscripts (from the sample of 679 abstracts), 99\% used real-world data and 29\% used synthetic data. 91\% of manuscripts did not report an uninformed baseline and 55\% reported a state-of-art baseline. 32\% reported confidence intervals for performance but none provided references or exposition for how these were calculated. 3\% reported formal comparisons. Limitations: The use of one journal as the primary information source may not be representative of all ML/AI literature. However, the NeurIPS conference is recognised to be amongst the top tier concerning ML/AI studies, so it is reasonable to consider its corpus to be representative of high-quality research. Conclusion: Using the 2017 sample of the NeurIPS supervised learning corpus as an indicator for the quality and trustworthiness of current ML/AI research, it appears that complete argumentative chains in demonstrations of algorithmic effectiveness are rare.},

abstract = {Numerous cancer studies have combined gene expression experiments and clinical survival data to predict the prognosis of patients of specific gene types. However, most results of these studies were data dependent and were not suitable for other data sets. This study performed cross-laboratory validations for the cancer patient data from 4 hospitals. We investigated the feasibility of survival risk predictions using high-throughput gene expression data and clinical data. We analyzed multiple data sets for prognostic applications in lung cancer diagnosis. After building tens of thousands of various ANN architectures using the training data, five survival-time correlated genes were identified from 4 microarray gene expression data sets by examining the correlation between gene signatures and patient survival time. The experimental results showed that gene expression data can be used for valid predictions of cancer patient survival classification with an overall accuracy of 83.0% based on survival time trusted data. The results show the prediction model yielded excellent predictions given that patients in the high-risk group obtained a lower median overall survival compared with low-risk patients (log-rank test P-value<0.00001). This study provides a foundation for further clinical studies and research into other types of cancer. We hope these findings will improve the prognostic methods of cancer patients.},

abstract = {The conjunction of wireless computing, ubiquitous Internet access, and the miniaturisation of sensors have opened the door for technological applications that can monitor health and well-being outside of formal healthcare systems.  The health-related Internet of Things (H-IoT) increasingly plays a key role in health management by providing real-time tele-monitoring of patients, testing of  treatments, actuation of medical devices, and fitness and well-being monitoring.   Given its numerous applications and proposed benefits, adoption by medical and social care institutions and consumers may be rapid. However, a host of ethical concerns are also raised that must be addressed. The inherent sensitivity of health-related data being generated and latent risks of Internet-enabled devices pose serious challenges. Users, already in a vulnerable position as patients, face a seemingly impossible task to retain control over their data due to the scale, scope and complexity of systems that create, aggregate, and analyse personal health data. In response, the H-IoT must be designed to be technologically robust and scientifically reliable, while also remaining ethically responsible, trustworthy, and respectful of user rights and interests. To assist developers of the H-IoT, this paper describes nine principles and nine guidelines for ethical design of H-IoT devices and data protocols.},

As an example, the method is applied to the use of the treadmill exercise test in evaluating the prognosis of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The treadmill test is shown to provide surprisingly little prognostic information beyond that obtained from basic clinical measurements.(JAMA 1982;247:2543-2546)},

abstract = {Survival analyses of populations and the establishment of prognoses for individual patients are important activities in the practice of medicine. Standard survival models, such as the Cox proportional hazards model, require extensive feature engineering or prior knowledge to model at an individual level. Some survival analysis models can avoid these problems by using machine learning extended the CPH model, and higher performance has been reported. In this paper, we propose an innovative loss function that is defined as the sum of an extended mean squared error loss and a pairwise ranking loss based on ranking information on survival data. We apply this loss function to optimize a deep feed-forward neural network (RankDeepSurv), which can be used to model survival data. We demonstrate that the performance of our model, RankDeepSurv, is superior to that of other state-of-the-art survival models based on an analysis of 4 public medical clinical datasets. When modelling the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), RankDeepSurv achieved better prognostic accuracy than the CPH established by clinical experts. The difference between high and low risk groups in the RankDeepSurv model is greater than the difference in the CPH. The results show that our method has considerable potential to model survival data in medical settings.},

@article{Nadeau2003,
abstract = {In order to compare learning algorithms, experimental results reported in the machine learning literature often use statistical tests of significance to support the claim that a new learning algorithm generalizes better. Such tests should take into account the variability due to the choice of training set and not only that due to the test examples, as is often the case. This could lead to gross underestimation of the variance of the cross-validation estimator, and to the wrong conclusion that the new algorithm is significantly better when it is not. We perform a theoretical investigation of the variance of a variant of the cross-validation estimator of the generalization error that takes into account the variability due to the randomness of the training set as well as test examples. Our analysis shows that all the variance estimators that are based only on the results of the cross-validation experiment must be biased. This analysis allows us to propose new estimators of this variance. We show, via simulations, that tests of hypothesis about the generalization error using those new variance estimators have better properties than tests involving variance estimators currently in use and listed in Dietterich (1998). In particular, the new tests have correct size and good power. That is, the new tests do not reject the null hypothesis too often when the hypothesis is true, but they tend to frequently reject the null hypothesis when the latter is false.},

Our aim was to investigate which histologic feature from the post-NAC surgical specimen independently correlated with metastatic relapse-free survival (MFS) in combination with clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features using a machine learning approach.METHODSThis retrospective study included 175 consecutive patients (median age: 59 years, 75 women) with resectable disease, treated with anthracycline-based NAC between 1989 and 2015 in our sarcoma reference center, and with quantitative histopathologic analysis of the surgical specimen. The outcome of interest was the MFS. A multimodel, multivariate survival analysis was used to define GHR. The added prognostic value of GHR was investigated through the comparisons with the standard model (including histologic grade, size, and depth) and SARCULATOR nomogram using concordance indices (c-index) and Monte-Carlo cross-validation.RESULTSSeventy-two patients (72 of 175, 41.1%) had a metastatic relapse. Stepwise Cox regression, random survival forests, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator?penalized Cox regression all converged toward the same definition for GHR, ie, < 5% stainable tumor cells. The five-year MFS probability was 1 (95% CI, 1 to 1) in patients with GHR versus 0.73 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.81) in patients without GHR (log-rank P = .0122). The final prognostic model incorporating the GHR was significantly better than the standard model and SARCULATOR (average c-index in testing sets = 0.72 [95% CI, 0.61 to 0.82] v 0.57 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.70] and 0.54 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.64], respectively; P = .0414 and .0091).CONCLUSIONHistologic response to NAC improves the prediction of MFS in patients with soft tissue sarcoma and represents a possible end point in future studies exploring innovative regimens in the neoadjuvant setting.},

@article{Bewick2021,
abstract = {As we close in on one year since the COVID-19 pandemic began, hope has been placed on bringing the virus under control through mass administration of recently developed vaccines. Unfortunately, newly emerged, fast-spreading strains of COVID-19 threaten to undermine progress by interfering with vaccine efficacy. While a long-term solution to this challenge would be to develop vaccines that simultaneously target multiple different COVID-19 variants, this approach faces both developmental and regulatory hurdles. A simpler option would be to switch the target of the current vaccine to better match the newest viral variant. I use a stochastic simulation to determine when it is better to target a newly emerged viral variant and when it is better to target the dominant but potentially less transmissible strain. My simulation results suggest that it is almost always better to target the faster spreading strain, even when the initial prevalence of this variant is much lower. In scenarios where targeting the slower spreading variant is best, all vaccination strategies perform relatively well, meaning that the choice of vaccination strategy has a small effect on public health outcomes. In scenarios where targeting the faster spreading variant is best, use of vaccines against the faster spreading viral variant can save many lives. My results provide ‘rule of thumb' guidance for those making critical decisions about vaccine formulation over the coming months.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding for this work was provided as part of Sharon Bewick&#039;s start-up package by The Biological Sciences Department at Clemson UniversityAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:n/aAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In the language of signal processing, this means consistency for de-noising using a strongly overcomplete dictionary if the underlying signal is sparse in terms of the <sub>1</sub>-norm. We also propose here an AIC-based method for tuning, namely for choosing the number of boosting iterations. This makes L<sub>2</sub>Boosting computationally attractive since it is not required to run the algorithm multiple times for cross-validation as commonly used so far. We demonstrate L<sub>2</sub>Boosting for simulated data, in particular where the predictor dimension is large in comparison to sample size, and for a difficult tumor-classification problem with gene expression microarray data.},

abstract = {The need for policy makers to understand science and for scientists to understand policy processes is widely recognised. However, the science-policy relationship is sometimes difficult and occasionally dysfunctional; it is also increasingly visible, because it must deal with contentious issues, or itself becomes a matter of public controversy, or both. We suggest that identifying key unanswered questions on the relationship between science and policy will catalyse and focus research in this field. To identify these questions, a collaborative procedure was employed with 52 participants selected to cover a wide range of experience in both science and policy, including people from government, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. These participants consulted with colleagues and submitted 239 questions. An initial round of voting was followed by a workshop in which 40 of the most important questions were identified by further discussion and voting. The resulting list includes questions about the effectiveness of science-based decision-making structures; the nature and legitimacy of expertise; the consequences of changes such as increasing transparency; choices among different sources of evidence; the implications of new means of characterising and representing uncertainties; and ways in which policy and political processes affect what counts as authoritative evidence. We expect this exercise to identify important theoretical questions and to help improve the mutual understanding and effectiveness of those working at the interface of science and policy.},

The model is centred on a parametric baseline hazard, and uses a Gaussian process to model variations away from it nonparametrically, as well as dependence on covariates. As opposed to many other methods in survival analysis, our framework does not impose unnecessary constraints in the hazard rate or in the survival function. Furthermore, our model handles left, right and interval censoring mechanisms common in survival analysis. We propose a MCMC algorithm to perform inference and an approximation scheme based on random Fourier features to make computations faster. We report experimental results on synthetic and real data, showing that our model performs better than competing models such as Cox proportional hazards, ANOVA-DDP and random survival forests.},

Whilst there is a lot of promising research currently being undertaken, the literature as a whole lacks: transparency; clear reporting to facilitate replicability; exploration for potential ethical concerns; and, clear demonstrations of effectiveness. There are many reasons for why these issues exist, but one of the most important that we provide a preliminary solution for here is the current lack of ML/AI- specific best practice guidance. Although there is no consensus on what best practice looks in this field, we believe that interdisciplinary groups pursuing research and impact projects in the ML/AI for health domain would benefit from answering a series of questions based on the important issues that exist when undertaking work of this nature. Here we present 20 questions that span the entire project life cycle, from inception, data analysis, and model evaluation, to implementation, as a means to facilitate project planning and post-hoc (structured) independent evaluation. By beginning to answer these questions in different settings, we can start to understand what constitutes a good answer, and we expect that the resulting discussion will be central to developing an international consensus framework for transparent, replicable, ethical and effective research in artificial intelligence (AI-TREE) for health.},

abstract = {Abstract In this article we show that traditional Cox survival analysis can be improved upon when supplemented with sensible priors and analysed within a neural Bayesian framework. We demonstrate that the Bayesian method gives more reliable predictions, in particular for relatively small data sets. The obtained posterior (the probability distribution of network parameters given the data) which in itself is intractable, can be made accessible by several approximations. We review approximations by Hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, a variational method and the Laplace approximation. We argue that although each Bayesian approach circumvents the shortcomings of the original Cox analysis, and therefore yields better predictive results, in practice the use of variational methods or Laplace is preferable. Since Cox survival analysis is infamous for its poor results with (too) many inputs, we use the Bayesian posterior to estimate p-values on the inputs and to formulate an algorithm for backward elimination. We show that after removal of irrelevant inputs Bayesian methods still achieve significantly better results than classical Cox. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The problem of defining prognostic groups on the basis of censored survival times and covariates is central in medical biostatistics. Several methods have been proposed, but little is known about their relative advantages. Here three methods are discussed: Stepwise Regression, Correspondence Analysis and Recursive Partition. The approach is empirical in that the focus is on the performance on real data sets. Our example is discussed at length. We find that Stepwise Regression has the advantage of flexibility and economy of description, but is limited in discovering interactions and other complex features of the data. Correspondence Analysis is equally flexible, though less economical, and is very powerful in revealing unexpected features of the data: it is recommended as an exploratory tool. Recursive Partition is efficient in discovering interactions within large data sets and has the advantage of being the only method that produces clear descriptions in direct clinical terms; its flexibility, however, is limited, especially when the number of covariates is large relative to the number of individuals. Since no method is universally preferable, their joint use is recommended. A variety of criteria for ranking stratifications are proposed when a choice to be made. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the free light chain (FLC) assay provides prognostic information relevant to the general population. METHODS: After excluding persons with a known plasma cell disorder, we studied 15,859 Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents 50 years or older in whom unmasked data and samples for FLC testing were available. Baseline information was obtained between March 13, 1995, and November 21, 2003, and follow-up status and cause of death were identified through June 30, 2009. The $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ FLC sum ($\Sigma$ FLC) was evaluated for its ability to predict overall survival. Specific causes of death were also investigated. RESULTS: In 158,003 person-years of follow-up, 4348 individuals died. A high $\Sigma$ FLC was significantly predictive of worse overall survival; the risk ratio for death for those with the highest decile of $\Sigma$ FLC (ie, ≥ 4.72 mg/dL) was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, 4.1-4.7) relative to the remaining study participants. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that this excess risk of death was independent of age, sex, and renal insufficiency, with a corrected risk ratio of 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-2.2). The increased mortality was not restricted to any particular cause of death because the observed-to-expected risk of death from most causes was significantly higher among those individuals with an antecedent $\Sigma$ FLC of 4.72 mg/dL or higher, which is near the upper limit of normal for the test. CONCLUSION: A nonclonal elevation of $\Sigma$ FLC is a significant predictor of worse overall survival in the general population of persons without plasma cell disorders.},

The patients were randomly divided into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). Fivefold cross validation was performed utilizing the training set. The test set was retained for the final testing. A Cox proportional hazard model, simple neural network, and the proposed survival neural network were all trained utilizing the same training set, and fivefold cross validation was performed. The final testing was performed utilizing the isolated test data to determine the best prediction model. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that size, initial metastasis, and margin were independent prognostic factors. In fivefold cross validation, the median value of the receiver-operating characteristic curve (area under the curve) was 0.87 in the survival neural network, which is significantly higher compared to the area under the curve of 0.792 for the simple neural network (p?=?0.043). In the final test, survival neural network model showed the better performance (area under the curve: 0.814) compared to the Cox proportional hazard model (area under the curve: 0.629; p?=?0.0001). The survival neural network model predicted survival of synovial sarcoma patients more accurately compared to Cox proportional hazard model.},

abstract = {Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, nonproportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

We propose the use of a least-squares support vector machine combining ranking and regression. The advantage of this kernel-based model is threefold: (i) the problem formulation is convex and can be solved conveniently by a linear system; (ii) non-linearity is introduced by using kernels, componentwise kernels in particular are useful to obtain interpretable results; and (iii) introduction of ranking constraints makes it possible to handle censored data. In an experimental setup, the model is used as a preprocessing step for the standard Cox proportional hazard regression by estimating the functional forms of the covariates. The proposed model was compared with different survival models from the literature on the clinical German Breast Cancer Study Group data and on the high-dimensional Norway/Stanford Breast Cancer Data set.

Estimation proceeds via multiple imputation, where censored failure times are imputed under user-specified departures from independent censoring. A novel aspect of our method is the use of bootstrapping to generate proper imputations from the Cox model.

abstract = {Abstract Simulation studies present an important statistical tool to investigate the performance, properties and adequacy of statistical models in pre-specified situations. One of the most important statistical models in medical research is the proportional hazards model of Cox. In this paper, techniques to generate survival times for simulation studies regarding Cox proportional hazards models are presented. A general formula describing the relation between the hazard and the corresponding survival time of the Cox model is derived, which is useful in simulation studies. It is shown how the exponential, the Weibull and the Gompertz distribution can be applied to generate appropriate survival times for simulation studies. Additionally, the general relation between hazard and survival time can be used to develop own distributions for special situations and to handle flexibly parameterized proportional hazards models. The use of distributions other than the exponential distribution is indispensable to investigate the characteristics of the Cox proportional hazards model, especially in non-standard situations, where the partial likelihood depends on the baseline hazard. A simulation study investigating the effect of measurement errors in the German Uranium Miners Cohort Study is considered to illustrate the proposed simulation techniques and to emphasize the importance of a careful modelling of the baseline hazard in Cox models.

abstract = {Measures of predictive ability play an important role in quantifying the clinical significance of prognostic factors. Several measures have been proposed to evaluate the predictive ability of survival models in the last two decades, but no single measure is consistently used. The proposed measures can be classified into the following categories: explained variation, explained randomness, and predictive accuracy. The three categories are conceptually different and are based on different principles. Several new measures have been proposed since Schemper and Stare's study in 1996 on some of the existing measures. This paper is the first of two papers that study the proposed measures systematically by applying a set of criteria that a measure of predictive ability should possess in the context of survival analysis. The present paper focuses on the explained variation category, and part II studies the proposed measures in the other categories. Simulation studies are used to examine the performance of five explained variation measures with respect to these criteria, discussing their strengths and shortcomings. Our simulation studies show that the measures proposed by Kent and O'Quigley, R, and Royston and Sauerbrei, R, appear to be the best overall at quantifying predictive ability. However, it should be noted that neither measure is perfect; R is sensitive to outliers and R to (marked) non-normality of the distribution of the prognostic index. The results show that the other measures perform poorly, primarily because they are adversely affected by censoring. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {For an experimental animal exposed to k greater than 1 possible risks of death R1, R2, ..., Rk, the term i-th potential survival time designates a random variable Yi supposed to represent the age at death of the animal in hypothetical conditions in which Ri is the only possible risk. The probability that Yi will exceed a preassigned t is called the i-th net survival probability. The results of a survival experiment are represented by k "crude" survival functions, empirical counterparts of the probabilities Qi(t) that an animal will survive at least up to the age t and eventually die from Ri. The analysis of a survival experiment aims at estimating the k net survival probabilities using the empirical data on those termed crude. Therorems 1 and 2 establish the relationship between the net and the crude probabilities of survival. In particular, Theorem 2 shows that, without the not directly verifiable assumption that in their joint distribution the variables Y1, Y2, ..., Yk are mutually independent, a given set of crude survival probabilities Qi(t) does not identify the corresponding net probabilities. An example shows that the results of a customary method of analysis, based on the assumption that Y1, Y2, ..., Yk are independent, may have no resemblance to reality.},

Study data were extracted in duplicate on design, sample size, handling of missing data, reference to the original study developing the prediction models and predictive performance measures.\n\nRESULTS: 11,826 articles were identified and 78 were included for full review, which described the evaluation of 120 prediction models. in participant data that were not used to develop the model. Thirty-three articles described both the development of a prediction model and an evaluation of its performance on a separate dataset, and 45 articles described only the evaluation of an existing published prediction model on another dataset. Fifty-seven percent of the prediction models were presented and evaluated as simplified scoring systems. Sixteen percent of articles failed to report the number of outcome events in the validation datasets. Fifty-four percent of studies made no explicit mention of missing data. Sixty-seven percent did not report evaluating model calibration whilst most studies evaluated model discrimination. It was often unclear whether the reported performance measures were for the full regression model or for the simplified models.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of studies describing some form of external validation of a multivariable prediction model were poorly reported with key details frequently not presented. The validation studies were characterised by poor design, inappropriate handling and acknowledgement of missing data and one of the most key performance measures of prediction models i.e. calibration often omitted from the publication. It may therefore not be surprising that an overwhelming majority of developed prediction models are not used in practice, when there is a dearth of well-conducted and clearly reported (external validation) studies describing their performance on independent participant data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe the relationship between type 2 diabetes and all-cause mortality among adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the critical care setting.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a nationwide retrospective cohort study in people admitted to hospital in England with COVID-19 requiring admission to a high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ICU) between 1 March 2020 and 27 July 2020. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate 30-day in-hospital all-cause mortality associated with type 2 diabetes, with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, and other major comorbidities (chronic respiratory disease, asthma, chronic heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, chronic neurological disease, chronic renal disease, and chronic liver disease).RESULTS A total of 19,256 COVID-19–related HDU and ICU admissions were included in the primary analysis, including 13,809 HDU (mean age 70 years) and 5,447 ICU (mean age 58 years) admissions. Of those admitted, 3,524 (18.3%) had type 2 diabetes and 5,077 (26.4%) died during the study period. Patients with type 2 diabetes were at increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.23 [95% CI 1.14, 1.32]), and this result was consistent in HDU and ICU subsets. The relative mortality risk associated with type 2 diabetes decreased with higher age (age 18–49 years aHR 1.50 [95% CI 1.05, 2.15], age 50–64 years 1.29 [1.10, 1.51], and age ≥65 years 1.18 [1.09, 1.29], P value for age–type 2 diabetes interaction = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS Type 2 diabetes may be an independent prognostic factor for survival in people with severe COVID-19 requiring critical care treatment, and in this setting the risk increase associated with type 2 diabetes is greatest in younger people.},

Patients have specific needs, such as avoiding being surprised by a possible outcome and making complex risk trade-off decisions. Yet all risk information is not equally informative for those needs. In this article, I present a taxonomy of seven risk concepts that vary in their inherent precision and evaluability. Congruent with the ?less is more? concept, I argue that risk communications should use formats that are tailored to message recipients? specific informational needs. Simpler formats can be used when patients only need to order risks, while more complex numerical probability statements will be necessary when patients need to assess differences in risk magnitude and put those differences into meaningful context. Selecting need-congruent formats when designing communications about risks to patients is a novel approach that may better support patients? health care decision making.},

@article{Breiman1992,
abstract = {Often, in a regression situation with many variables, a sequence of submodels is generated containing fewer variables by using such methods as stepwise addition or deletion of variables, or 'best subsets'. The question is which of this sequence of submodels is 'best', and how can submodel performance be evaluated. This was explored in Breiman (1988) for a fixed X-design. This is a sequel exploring the case of random X-designs. Analytical results are difficult, if not impossible. This study involved an extensive simulation. The basis of the study is the theoretical definition of prediction error (PE) as the expected squared error produced by applying a prediction equation to the distributional universe of (y, x) values. This definition is used throughout to compare various submodels. There can be startling differences between the x-fixed and x-random situations and different PE estimates are appropriate. Non-resampling estimates such as CP, adjusted R2, etc. turn out to be highly biased methods for submodel selection. The two best methods are cross-validation and bootstrap. One surprise is that 5 fold cross-validation (leave out 20% of the data) is better at submodel selection and evaluation than leave-one-out cross-validation. There are a number of other surprises. /// Dans l'analyse de probl&#xe8;mes de r&#xe9;gression &#xe0; plusieurs variables (ind&#xe9;pendantes), on produit souvent une s&#xe9;rie de sous-mod&#xe8;les constitu&#xe9;s d'un sous-ensemble des variables par des m&#xe9;thodes telles que l'addition par &#xe9;tape, le retrait par &#xe9;tape et la m&#xe9;thode du meilleur sous-ensemble.

abstract = {Survival analysis mainly deals with the time to event, including death, onset of disease, and bankruptcy. The common characteristic of survival analysis is that it contains "censored" data, in which the time to event cannot be completely observed, but instead represents the lower bound of the time to event. Only the occurrence of either time to event or censoring time is observed. Many traditional statistical methods have been effectively used for analyzing survival data with censored observations. However, with the development of high-throughput technologies for producing "omics" data, more advanced statistical methods, such as regularization, should be required to construct the predictive survival model with high-dimensional genomic data. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have been adapted for survival analysis, to fit nonlinear and complex interaction effects between predictors, and achieve more accurate prediction of individual survival probability. Presently, since most clinicians and medical researchers can easily assess statistical programs for analyzing survival data, a review article is helpful for understanding statistical methods used in survival analysis. We review traditional survival methods and regularization methods, with various penalty functions, for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics, and describe machine learning techniques that have been adapted to survival analysis.},

abstract = {<p> Survival analysis is a subfield of statistics where the goal is to analyze and model data where the outcome is the time until an event of interest occurs. One of the main challenges in this context is the presence of instances whose event outcomes become unobservable after a certain time point or when some instances do not experience any event during the monitoring period. This so-called <italic>censoring</italic> can be handled most effectively using survival analysis techniques. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been widely developed in the literature to overcome the issue of censoring. In addition, many machine learning algorithms have been adapted to deal with such censored data and tackle other challenging problems that arise in real-world data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the statistical methods typically used and the machine learning techniques developed for survival analysis, along with a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and describe several successful applications in a variety of real-world application domains. We hope that this article will give readers a more comprehensive understanding of recent advances in survival analysis and offer some guidelines for applying these approaches to solve new problems arising in applications involving censored data. </p>},

@article{Chambless2006,
abstract = {Abstract Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) are often used to measure the ability of survival models to predict future risk. Estimation of these parameters is complicated by the fact that these parameters are time-dependent and by the fact that censoring affects their estimation just as it affects estimation of survival curves or coefficients of survival regression models. The authors present several estimators that overcome these complications. One approach is a recursive calculation over the ordered times of events, analogous to the Kaplan?Meier approach to survival function estimation. Another is to first apply Bayes' theorem to write the parameters of interest in terms of conditional survival functions that are then estimated by survival analysis methods. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform well in practical situations, when compared with an estimator (c-statistic, from logistic regression) that ignores time. An illustration with data from a cardiovascular follow-up study is provided. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The method uses a "stacking" idea that collects the features and outcomes of the survival data in a large data frame, and then treats it as a classification problem. In this framework, various statistical learning algorithms (including logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting machines and neural networks) can be applied to estimate the parameters and make predictions. For stacking with logistic regression, we show that this approach is approximately equivalent to the Cox proportional hazards model with both theoretical analysis and simulation studies. For stacking with other machine learning algorithms, we show through simulation studies that our method can outperform Cox proportional hazards model in terms of estimated survival curves. This idea is not new, but we believe that it should be better known by statistiicians and other data scientists.},

The accuracy of cancer prognosis prediction will greatly benefit clinical management of cancer patients. The improvement of biomedical translational research and the application of advanced statistical analysis and machine learning methods are the driving forces to improve cancer prognosis prediction. Recent years, there is a significant increase of computational power and rapid advancement in the technology of artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning. In addition, the cost reduction in large scale next-generation sequencing, and the availability of such data through open source databases (e.g., TCGA and GEO databases) offer us opportunities to possibly build more powerful and accurate models to predict cancer prognosis more accurately. In this review, we reviewed the most recent published works that used deep learning to build models for cancer prognosis prediction. Deep learning has been suggested to be a more generic model, requires less data engineering, and achieves more accurate prediction when working with large amounts of data. The application of deep learning in cancer prognosis has been shown to be equivalent or better than current approaches, such as Cox-PH. With the burst of multi-omics data, including genomics data, transcriptomics data and clinical information in cancer studies, we believe that deep learning would potentially improve cancer prognosis.},

Repeat measurements of the predictor in individuals in a subset of the study or in a separate study can be used to estimate a multiplicative factor to correct for this 'regression dilution bias'. In applied statistics publications various methods have been used to estimate this correction factor. Here we compare six different estimation methods and explain how they fall into two categories, namely regression and correlation-based methods. We provide new asymptotic variance formulae for the optimal correction factors in each category, when these are estimated from the repeat measurements subset alone, and show analytically and by simulation that the correlation method of choice gives uniformly lower variance. The simulations also show that, when the correction factor is not much greater than 1, this correlation method gives a correction factor which is closer to the true value than that from the best regression method on up to 80% of occasions. We also provide a variance formula for a modified correlation method which uses the standard deviation of the predictor variable in the main study; this shows further improved performance provided that the correction factor is not too extreme. A confidence interval for a corrected regression slope in an epidemiological study should reflect the imprecision of both the uncorrected slope and the estimated correction factor. We provide formulae for this and show that, particularly when the correction factor is large and the size of the subset of repeat measures is small, the effect of allowing for imprecision in the estimated correction factor can be substantial.]},

abstract = {Abstract In disease screening and prognosis studies, an important task is to determine useful markers for identifying high-risk subgroups. Once such markers are established, they can be incorporated into public health practice to provide appropriate strategies for treatment or disease monitoring based on each individual's predicted risk. In the recent years, genetic and biological markers have been examined extensively for their potential to signal progression or risk of disease. In addition to these markers, it has often been argued that short-term outcomes may be helpful in making a better prediction of disease outcomes in clinical practice. In this paper we propose model-free non-parametric procedures to incorporate short-term event information to improve the prediction of a long-term terminal event. We include the optional availability of a single discrete marker measurement and assess the additional information gained by including the short-term outcome. We focus on the semi-competing risk setting where the short-term event is an intermediate event that may be censored by the terminal event while the terminal event is only subject to administrative censoring. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed procedures perform well in finite samples. Our procedures are illustrated using a data set of post-dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease.},

abstract = {Predicting outcomes that occur over time is important in clinical, population health, and health services research. We compared changes in different measures of performance when a novel risk factor or marker was added to an existing Cox proportional hazards regression model. We performed Monte Carlo simulations for common measures of performance: concordance indices (c, including various extensions to survival outcomes), Royston's D index, R(2)-type measures, and Chambless' adaptation of the integrated discrimination improvement to survival outcomes. We found that the increase in performance due to the inclusion of a risk factor tended to decrease as the performance of the reference model increased. Moreover, the increase in performance increased as the hazard ratio or the prevalence of a binary risk factor increased. Finally, for the concordance indices and R(2)-type measures, the absolute increase in predictive accuracy due to the inclusion of a risk factor was greater when the observed event rate was higher (low censoring). Amongst the different concordance indices, Chambless and Diao's c-statistic exhibited the greatest increase in predictive accuracy when a novel risk factor was added to an existing model. Amongst the different R(2)-type measures, O'Quigley et al.'s modification of Nagelkerke's R(2) index and Kent and O'Quigley's [Formula: see text] displayed the greatest sensitivity to the addition of a novel risk factor or marker. These methods were then applied to a cohort of 8635 patients hospitalized with heart failure to examine the added benefit of a point-based scoring system for predicting mortality after initial adjustment with patient age alone.},

abstract = {Prediction performance of a risk scoring system needs to be carefully assessed before its adoption in clinical practice. Clinical preventive care often uses risk scores to screen asymptomatic population. The primary clinical interest is to predict the risk of having an event by a prespecified future time t0. Accuracy measures such as positive predictive values have been recommended for evaluating the predictive performance. However, for commonly used continuous or ordinal risk score systems, these measures require a subjective cutoff threshold value that dichotomizes the risk scores. The need for a cutoff value created barriers for practitioners and researchers. In this paper, we propose a threshold-free summary index of positive predictive values that accommodates time-dependent event status and competing risks. We develop a nonparametric estimator and provide an inference procedure for comparing this summary measure between 2 risk scores for censored time to event data. We conduct a simulation study to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimation and inference procedures. Lastly, we illustrate the use of this measure on a real data example, comparing 2 risk score systems for predicting heart failure in childhood cancer survivors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Random survival forest (RSF) models have been identified as alternative methods to the Cox proportional hazards model in analysing time-to-event data. These methods, however, have been criticised for the bias that results from favouring covariates with many split-points and hence conditional inference forests for time-to-event data have been suggested. Conditional inference forests (CIF) are known to correct the bias in RSF models by separating the procedure for the best covariate to split on from that of the best split point search for the selected covariate. METHODS: In this study, we compare the random survival forest model to the conditional inference model (CIF) using twenty-two simulated time-to-event datasets. We also analysed two real time-to-event datasets. The first dataset is based on the survival of children under-five years of age in Uganda and it consists of categorical covariates with most of them having more than two levels (many split-points). The second dataset is based on the survival of patients with extremely drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) which consists of mainly categorical covariates with two levels (few split-points). RESULTS: The study findings indicate that the conditional inference forest model is superior to random survival forest models in analysing time-to-event data that consists of covariates with many split-points based on the values of the bootstrap cross-validated estimates for integrated Brier scores. However, conditional inference forests perform comparably similar to random survival forests models in analysing time-to-event data consisting of covariates with fewer split-points. CONCLUSION: Although survival forests are promising methods in analysing time-to-event data, it is important to identify the best forest model for analysis based on the nature of covariates of the dataset in question.},

Feed forward neural networks were recently considered for flexible non-linear modelling of censored survival data through the generalization of both discrete and continuous time models. We show that by treating the time interval as an input variable in a standard feed forward network with logistic activation and entropy error function, it is possible to estimate smoothed discrete hazards as conditional probabilities of failure. We considered an easily implementable approach with a fast selection criteria of the best configurations. Examples on data sets from two clinical trials are provided. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) approach can be applied for the estimation of the functional relationships between covariates and time in survival data to improve model predictivity in the presence of complex prognostic relationships. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

We provide a formal proof that the estimator proposed by Schemper and Henderson is not robust against misspecification of the survival model, that is, the estimator will only be meaningful if the model family used for deriving predictions has been specified correctly. To remedy this problem, we construct a new estimator of the absolute distance between predicted and observed survival functions. We show that this modified Schemper-Henderson estimator is robust against model misspecification, allowing its practical application to a wide class of survival models. The properties of the Schemper-Henderson estimator and its new modification are illustrated by means of a simulation study and the analysis of two clinical data sets.},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

abstract = {Cancer survival studies are commonly analyzed using survival-time prediction models for cancer prognosis. A number of different performance metrics are used to ascertain the concordance between the predicted risk score of each patient and the actual survival time, but these metrics can sometimes conflict. Alternatively, patients are sometimes divided into two classes according to a survival-time threshold, and binary classifiers are applied to predict each patient's class. Although this approach has several drawbacks, it does provide natural performance metrics such as positive and negative predictive values to enable unambiguous assessments. We compare the survival-time prediction and survival-time threshold approaches to analyzing cancer survival studies. We review and compare common performance metrics for the two approaches. We present new randomization tests and cross-validation methods to enable unambiguous statistical inferences for several performance metrics used with the survival-time prediction approach. We consider five survival prediction models consisting of one clinical model, two gene expression models, and two models from combinations of clinical and gene expression models. A public breast cancer dataset was used to compare several performance metrics using five prediction models. 1) For some prediction models, the hazard ratio from fitting a Cox proportional hazards model was significant, but the two-group comparison was insignificant, and vice versa. 2) The randomization test and cross-validation were generally consistent with the p-values obtained from the standard performance metrics. 3) Binary classifiers highly depended on how the risk groups were defined; a slight change of the survival threshold for assignment of classes led to very different prediction results. 1) Different performance metrics for evaluation of a survival prediction model may give different conclusions in its discriminatory ability. 2) Evaluation using a high-risk versus low-risk group comparison depends on the selected risk-score threshold; a plot of p-values from all possible thresholds can show the sensitivity of the threshold selection. 3) A randomization test of the significance of Somers' rank correlation can be used for further evaluation of performance of a prediction model. 4) The cross-validated power of survival prediction models decreases as the training and test sets become less balanced.},

abstract = {Because of censoring, standard methods of plotting individual survival times are invalid. Therefore, graphic display of time-to-event data usually takes the form of a Kaplan–Meier survival plot. Kaplan–Meier plots, however, make differences between groups seem larger than they really are. To overcome these limitations, we developed a technique for producing scatter plots with survival data and applied it to data from a randomized trial of patients with renal cancer. As of June 21, 2001, 25 of the 347 patients with kidney cancer in the Medical Research Council RE01 randomized treatment trial for whom data were available had been censored, and the remainder had died. Values of the censored survival times were imputed by assuming a log-normal distribution in survival times and by drawing a random sample given that that each patient with censored data survived at least to the point of censoring. The combined original and imputed data were then examined by use of dot plots and scatter plots. In the RE01 trial, median survival of patients treated with interferon was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval = 0.3 to 5.5 months) longer than that in patients treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Kaplan–Meier analysis showed clear separation between treatment groups and between prognostic groups. In contrast, comparisons of individual observed and imputed survival times between groups of patients showed considerable overlap and gave a more realistic idea of the modest between-group differences than Kaplan–Meier comparisons. These graphs of the distribution of survival times for individuals in each study group, which are simple to produce, may usefully complement Kaplan–Meier plots.},

abstract = {Many health and safety problems, including war and terrorism, are by-products of how people reason about risk. I describe a new approach to reasoning about risk that implements a modern dual-process model of memory called fuzzy-trace theory. This approach posits encoding of both verbatim and gist representations, with reliance on the latter whenever possible; dependence of reasoning on retrieval cues that access stored values and principles; and vulnerability of reasoning to processing interference from overlapping classes of events, which causes denominator neglect in risk or probability judgments. These simple principles explain classic and new findings, for example, the finding that people overestimate small risks but ignore very small risks. Fuzzy-trace theory differs from other dual-process approaches to reasoning in that it places intuition at the apex of development, considering fuzzy intuitive processing more advanced than precise computational processing (e.g., trading off risks and rewards). The theory supplies a conception of rationality that distinguishes degrees of severity of errors in reasoning. It also includes a mechanism for achieving consistency in reasoning, a hallmark of rationality, by explaining how a person can treat superficially different reasoning problems in the same way if the problems share an underlying gist.},

abstract = {Recent population-based data on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) epidemiology in general, and incidence in particular, are lacking. We examined trends in NAFLD incidence in a U.S. community and the impact of NAFLD on incident metabolic comorbidities (MCs), cardiovascular (CV) events, and mortality. A community cohort of all adults diagnosed with NAFLD in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 1997 and 2014 was constructed using the Rochester Epidemiology Project database. The yearly incidence rate were calculated. The impact of NAFLD on incident MCs, CV events, and mortality was studied using a multistate model, with a 4:1 age- and sex-matched general population as a reference. We identified 3,869 NAFLD subjects (median age, 53; 52% women) and 15,209 controls; median follow-up was 7 (1-20) years. NAFLD incidence increased 5-fold, from 62 to 329 in 100,000 person-years. The increase was highest (7-fold) in young adults, aged 18-39 years. The 10-year mortality was higher in NAFLD subjects (10.2%) than controls (7.6%; P < 0.0001). NAFLD was an independent risk factor for incident MCs and death. Mortality risk decreased as the number of incident MCs increased: relative risk (RR) = 2.16 (95% confidence [CI], 1.41-3.31), 1.99 (95% CI, 1.48-2.66), 1.75 (95% CI, 1.42-2.14), and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.89-1.30) when 0, 1, 2, or 3 MCs were present, respectively. The NAFLD impact on CV events was significant only in subjects without MCs (RR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.35-2.86). NAFLD reduced life expectancy by 4 years, with more time spent in high metabolic burden. CONCLUSION: Incidence of NAFLD diagnosis in the community has increased 5-fold, particularly in young adults. NAFLD is a consequence, but also a precursor of MC. Incident MC attenuates the impact of NAFLD on death and annuls its impact on CV disease. (Hepatology 2018;67:1726-1736).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A prognostic model should not enter clinical practice unless it has been demonstrated that it performs a useful role. External validation denotes evaluation of model performance in a sample independent of that used to develop the model. Unlike for logistic regression models, external validation of Cox models is sparsely treated in the literature. Successful validation of a model means achieving satisfactory discrimination and calibration (prediction accuracy) in the validation sample. Validating Cox models is not straightforward because event probabilities are estimated relative to an unspecified baseline function.\n\nMETHODS: We describe statistical approaches to external validation of a published Cox model according to the level of published information, specifically (1) the prognostic index only, (2) the prognostic index together with Kaplan-Meier curves for risk groups, and (3) the first two plus the baseline survival curve (the estimated survival function at the mean prognostic index across the sample). The most challenging task, requiring level 3 information, is assessing calibration, for which we suggest a method of approximating the baseline survival function.\n\nRESULTS: We apply the methods to two comparable datasets in primary breast cancer, treating one as derivation and the other as validation sample. Results are presented for discrimination and calibration. We demonstrate plots of survival probabilities that can assist model evaluation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our validation methods are applicable to a wide range of prognostic studies and provide researchers with a toolkit for external validation of a published Cox model.},

Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

In many of these scenarios, previous decisions have been made that are unfairly biased against certain subpopulations, for example those of a particular race, gender, or sexual orientation. Since this past data may be biased, machine learning predictors must account for this to avoid perpetuating or creating discriminatory practices. In this paper, we develop a framework for modeling fairness using tools from causal inference. Our definition of counterfactual fairness captures the intuition that a decision is fair towards an individual if it is the same in (a) the actual world and (b) a counterfactual world where the individual belonged to a different demographic group. We demonstrate our framework on a real-world problem of fair prediction of success in law school.},

Motivation for the formulation of the generalized procedures is provided heuristically by appealing to the basic concept upon which the procedures for uncensored data are based; a theoretical motivation is provided by asymptotic weak convergence results. The size and power of the generalized Smirnov two-sample procedure are evaluated for small and moderate sample sizes using Monte Carlo simulations. Results of the simulations are also used to make comparisons with the Gehan-Wilcoxon and logrank two-sample test procedures. The generalized Smirnov procedure is found to maintain the size of the test in nearly all the cases studied, although it is conservative in small samples of heavily censored data. It is found to be more powerful than both the Gehan-Wilcoxon and the logrank procedures for the non-Lehmann alternatives considered.]},

abstract = {Summary There is no shortage of proposed measures of prognostic value of survival models in the statistical literature. They come under different names, including explained variation, correlation, explained randomness, and information gain, but their goal is common: to define something analogous to the coefficient of determination R(2)  in linear regression. None however have been uniformly accepted, none have been extended to general event history data, including recurrent events, and many cannot incorporate time-varying effects or covariates. We present here a measure specifically tailored for use with general dynamic event history regression models. The measure is applicable and interpretable in discrete or continuous time; with tied data or otherwise; with time-varying, time-fixed, or dynamic covariates; with time-varying or time-constant effects; with single or multiple event times; with parametric or semiparametric models; and under general independent censoring/observation. For single-event survival data with neither censoring nor time dependency it reduces to the concordance index. We give expressions for its population value and the variance of the estimator and explore its use in simulations and applications. A web link to R software is provided.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how these measures compare and work out the conceptual differences between them. Both compare the variance when a covariate is accounted for with the variance when it is ignored, but only the second incorporates differences between observed and fitted outcomes. First, the relationship between both measures is studied for the situation without censoring. It turns out that considering the explained variation as a process in time is helpful in this context as well as in its own right. Censoring is incorporated quite differently for the two measures.

In a Monte Carlo simulation study, we evaluated the performance of all three NN methods with that of Cox regression models which included main effects and interactions, when interactions exist. Using the EPILOG PLUS{\textregistered} PROC NEURAL utility, feed-forward back-propagation networks were examined under nine designs representing a variety of experimental conditions which varied (a) the number of inputs and interactions, (b) the degree of censoring, (c) proportional vs. non-proportional hazards, and (d) sample size. Minimization methods were implemented that efficiently determined optimal parameters. The C-index was used as a measure of performance. For the testing phase of the study, none of the NN methods outperformed Cox regression. Compared to Cox regression, the Faraggi–Simon, Buckley–James, and Liestol–Andersen–Andersen methods performed as well as Cox regression for 7,5 and 1 of the nine designs, respectively. The effect on performance of modeling interactions in Cox regression, varying the number of intervals in the Liestol–Andersen–Andersen method, and varying the NN architecture are also presented. The results of our study suggest that NNs can serve as effective methods for modeling right-censored data. However, the performance of the NN is somewhat variable, depending on the underlying data structure.},

@article{datamyeloid,
abstract = {Background/aims The goal of this article is to illustrate the utility of multi-state models in cancer clinical trials. Our specific aims are to describe multi-state models and how they differ from standard survival methods, to illustrate how multi-state models can facilitate deeper understanding of the treatment effect on multiple paths along the disease process that patients could experience in cancer clinical trials, to explain the differences between multi-state models and time-dependent Cox models, and to briefly describe available software to conduct such analyses. Methods Data from 717 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients who enrolled in the CALGB 10603 trial were used as an illustrative example. The current probability-in-state was estimated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. The restricted mean time in state was calculated as the area under the probability-in-state curves. Cox-type regression was used to evaluate the effect of midostaurin on the various clinical paths. Simulation was conducted using a newly constructed shiny application. All analyses were performed using the R software. Results Multi-state model analyses of CALGB 10603 suggested that the overall improvement in survival with midostaurin seen in the primary analysis possibly resulted from a higher complete remission rate in combination with a lower risk of relapse and of death after complete remission in patients treated with midostaurin. Simulation results, in a three-state illness-death without recovery model, demonstrate that multi-state models and time-dependent Cox models evaluate treatment effects from different frameworks. Conclusion Multi-state models allow detailed evaluation of treatment effects in complex clinical trial settings where patients can experience multiple paths between study enrollment and the final outcome. Multi-state models can be used as a complementary tool to standard survival analyses to provide deeper insights to the effects of treatment in trial settings with complex disease process.},

abstract = {Disclosure of prognosis in end-of-life care is a practice that is widely and increasingly recommended. However, prognostic disclosure is known to be resisted by many dying persons and by physicians, who instead engage in a "collusion of silence"-discussing prognosis either not at all or in vague, indirect terms. Debates about the ethics of prognostic disclosure and non-disclosure have tended to focus on their relative benefits and harms, or on the psychological acceptability of prognostic information to dying persons. Unaddressed, however, is a more fundamental assumption upon which the practice of prognostic disclosure depends: that prognostic certainty is what dying persons ultimately need. In this essay I question this assumption. Reflecting on the experience of my father's recent death, I argue that prognostic certainty is not only unattainable but existentially irrelevant to many dying persons, and that prognostic uncertainty can be a greater need. Respect for individuals' existential need for uncertainty justifies prognostic silence and enables dying persons-as well as the loved ones and clinicians who care for them-to be open to new possibilities of finding meaning at the end of life.},

abstract = {Motion analysis is used in computer vision to understand the behaviour of moving objects in sequences of images. Optimizing the interpretation of dynamic biological systems requires accurate and precise motion tracking as well as efficient representations of high-dimensional motion trajectories so that these can be used for prediction tasks. Here we use image sequences of the heart, acquired using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, to create time-resolved three-dimensional segmentations using a fully convolutional network trained on anatomical shape priors. This dense motion model formed the input to a supervised denoising autoencoder (4Dsurvival), which is a hybrid network consisting of an autoencoder that learns a task-specific latent code representation trained on observed outcome data, yielding a latent representation optimized for survival prediction. To handle right-censored survival outcomes, our network used a Cox partial likelihood loss function. In a study of 302 patients, the predictive accuracy (quantified by Harrell's C-index) was significantly higher (P = 0.0012) for our model C = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70–0.79) than the human benchmark of C = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.53–0.65). This work demonstrates how a complex computer vision task using high-dimensional medical image data can efficiently predict human survival.},

The field of meteorology, where the paradigm of maximizing sharpness subject to calibration is popular, has addressed this problem by using scoring rules beyond MLE, such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). In this paper we present the \emph{Survival-CRPS}, a generalization of the CRPS to the survival prediction setting, with right-censored and interval-censored variants. We evaluate our ideas on the mortality prediction task using two different Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sets (STARR and MIMIC-III) covering millions of patients, with suitable deep neural network architectures: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for STARR and a Fully Connected Network (FCN) for MIMIC-III. We compare results between the two scoring rules while keeping the network architecture and data fixed, and show that models trained with Survival-CRPS result in sharper predictive distributions compared to those trained by MLE, while still maintaining calibration.},

@article{Puddu2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Projection pursuit regression, multilayer feed-forward networks, multivariate adaptive regression splines and trees (including survival trees) have challenged classic multivariable models such as the multiple logistic function, the proportional hazards life table Cox model (Cox), the Poisson's model, and the Weibull's life table model to perform multivariable predictions. However, only artificial neural networks (NN) have become popular in medical applications.\n\nRESULTS: We compared several Cox versus NN models in predicting 45-year all-cause mortality (45-ACM) by 18 risk factors selected a priori: age; father life status; mother life status; family history of cardiovascular diseases; job-related physical activity; cigarette smoking; body mass index (linear and quadratic terms); arm circumference; mean blood pressure; heart rate; forced expiratory volume; serum cholesterol; corneal arcus; diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes; minor ECG abnormalities at rest. Two Italian rural cohorts of the Seven Countries Study, made up of men aged 40 to 59 years, enrolled and first examined in 1960 in Italy. Cox models were estimated by: a) forcing all factors; b) a forward-; and c) a backward-stepwise procedure. Observed cases of deaths and of survivors were computed in decile classes of estimated risk. Forced and stepwise NN were run and compared by C-statistics (ROC analysis) with the Cox models. Out of 1591 men, 1447 died. Model global accuracies were extremely high by all methods (ROCs > 0.810) but there was no clear-cut superiority of any model to predict 45-ACM. The highest ROCs (> 0.838) were observed by NN. There were inter-model variations to select predictive covariates: whereas all models concurred to define the role of 10 covariates (mainly cardiovascular risk factors), family history, heart rate and minor ECG abnormalities were not contributors by Cox models but were so by forced NN. Forced expiratory volume and arm circumference (two protectors), were not selected by stepwise NN but were so by the Cox models.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There were similar global accuracies of NN versus Cox models to predict 45-ACM. NN detected specific predictive covariates having a common thread with physical fitness as related to job physical activity such as arm circumference and forced expiratory volume. Future attention should be concentrated on why NN versus Cox models detect different predictors.},

abstract = {Predicting survival of recipients after liver transplantation is regarded as one of the most important challenges in contemporary medicine. Hence, improving on current prediction models is of great interest.Nowadays, there is a strong discussion in the medical field about machine learning (ML) and whether it has greater potential than traditional regression models when dealing with complex data. Criticism to ML is related to unsuitable performance measures and lack of interpretability which is important for clinicians.},

@phdthesis{Yang2010,
abstract = {In this study, we analyzed a data set from real commercial data on the purchase behaviors of 168 customers to predict the next purchase time. The data were grouped to the training set and test set, and analyzed by a piecewise standard Cox PH model, a piecewise marginal Cox model and the PLANN neural network approach. The effects of the following five factors were studied: the previous purchase interval, the type of a customer, the region and size of the city where a customer lives, and the season of the last purchase. The three models (two Cox's PH models and the ANN model) were used to predict the survival of the test set. In total eight subgroups of the test set were selected and their predicted survivals were compared to the KM survival estimates. The comparison shows that the ANN methods displayed similar predictability performance with that of the piecewise standard Cox PH model. Thus, the hypothesis that the ANN method is superior to the conventional Cox's PH models does not valid. The study reveals the following patterns in the purchase behaviors: 1) the next purchase interval approximately proportional to previous interval， while the output of the marginal Cox model indicates that for a customer the marginal effect of the previous interval on the next purchase interval is not significant. 2) The purchase interval of a customer living in big or medium city is not significant different with that of a customer in small or tiny city. 3) The customers whose types are ‘catering' or ‘horeca' have similar purchase trends and have shorter purchase periods than that of other type customers. The ‘particulier' customers tend to do their next purchase later. For the retail customer, no distinct results were shown. 4) The customers in Waals Brabant or Vlaams Braban tend to do their purchases after 7 days, while the customers in West Vlaanderen, Luxemburg and Limburg would like to purchase earlier than those in the other customers. 5) Customers tend to do the next purchases earlier during Apr. to Aug., and postpone the next purchases in Dec.},

abstract = {This article describes how the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations considers the Bradford Hill criteria for causation and how GRADE may relate to questions in public health. A primary concern in public health is that evidence from non-randomised studies may provide a more adequate or best available measure of a public health strategy's impact, but that such evidence might be graded as lower quality in the GRADE framework. GRADE, however, presents a framework that describes both criteria for assessing the quality of research evidence and the strength of recommendations that includes considerations arising from the Bradford Hill criteria. GRADE places emphasis on recommendations and in assessing quality of evidence; GRADE notes that randomisation is only one of many relevant factors. This article describes how causation may relate to developing recommendations and how the Bradford Hill criteria are considered in GRADE, using examples from the public health literature with a focus on immunisation.},

@article{Reyna2021,
abstract = {A framework is presented for understanding how misinformation shapes decision-making, which has cognitive representations of gist at its core. I discuss how the framework goes beyond prior work, and how it can be implemented so that valid scientific messages are more likely to be effective, remembered, and shared through social media, while misinformation is resisted. The distinction between mental representations of the rote facts of a message—its verbatim representation—and its gist explains several paradoxes, including the frequent disconnect between knowing facts and, yet, making decisions that seem contrary to those facts. Decision makers can falsely remember the gist as seen or heard even when they remember verbatim facts. Indeed, misinformation can be more compelling than information when it provides an interpretation of reality that makes better sense than the facts. Consequently, for many issues, scientific information and misinformation are in a battle for the gist. A fuzzy-processing preference for simple gist explains expectations for antibiotics, the spread of misinformation about vaccination, and responses to messages about global warming, nuclear proliferation, and natural disasters. The gist, which reflects knowledge and experience, induces emotions and brings to mind social values. However, changing mental representations is not sufficient by itself; gist representations must be connected to values. The policy choice is not simply between constraining behavior or persuasion—there is another option. Science communication needs to shift from an emphasis on disseminating rote facts to achieving insight, retaining its integrity but without shying away from emotions and values.There are no relevant data associated with the paper.},

The hybrid approach combines the regression and ranking constraints in a single model.

abstract = {The proposed techniques investigate the strength of support vector regression (SVR) in cancer prognosis using imaging features. Cancer image features were extracted from patients and recorded into censored data. To employ censored data for prognosis, SVR methods are needed to be adapted to uncertain targets. The effectiveness of two principle breast features, tumor size and lymph node status, was demonstrated by the combination of sampling and feature selection methods. In sampling, breast data were stratified according to tumor size and lymph node status. Three types of feature selection methods comprised of no selection, individual feature selection, and feature subset forward selection, were employed. The prognosis results were evaluated by comparative study using the following performance metrics: concordance index (CI) and Brier score (BS). Cox regression was employed to compare the results. The support vector regression method (SVCR) performs similarly to Cox regression in three feature selection methods and better than Cox regression in non-feature selection methods measured by CI and BS. Feature selection methods can improve the performance of Cox regression measured by CI. Among all cross validation results, stratified sampling of tumor size achieves the best regression results for both feature selection and non-feature selection methods. The SVCR regression results, perform better than Cox regression when the techniques are used with either CI or BS. The best CI value in the validation results is 0.6845. The best CI value corresponds to the best BS value 0.2065, which were obtained in the combination of SVCR, individual feature selection, and stratified sampling of the number of positive lymph nodes. In addition, we also observe that SVCR performs more consistently than Cox regression in all prognosis studies. The feature selection method does not have a significant impact on the metric values, especially on CI. We conclude that the combinational methods of SVCR, feature selection, and sampling can improve cancer prognosis, but more significant features may further enhance cancer prognosis accuracy.},

Survival curves and time-to-progression curves for the two regimens were nearly identical in these patients with advanced disease. These same regimens produced different results when used monthly in patients who had minimal residual disease (stages II and IIIA). In patients with minimal residual disease the therapeutic index of the combination regimen was superior to that of cyclophosphamide alone. Prognosis was better overall among patients with minimal residual disease than among patients with advanced disease. Within the minimal-disease group grossly complete excision of tumor prior to chemotherapy was associated with still better prognosis. Among patients with advanced disease, prognosis was significantly better for older patients despite their generally less favorable performance scores. Much of this prognostic superiority appeared to be related to menopausal status and presumably to the depletion of endogenous estrogens in the older patients.},

abstract = {Cancer is an aggressive disease with a low median survival rate. Ironically, the treatment process is long and very costly due to its high recurrence and mortality rates. Accurate early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of cancer are essential to enhance the patient's survival rate. Developments in statistics and computer engineering over the years have encouraged many scientists to apply computational methods such as multivariate statistical analysis to analyze the prognosis of the disease, and the accuracy of such analyses is significantly higher than that of empirical predictions. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning and deep learning, has found popular applications in clinical cancer research in recent years, cancer prediction performance has reached new heights. This article reviews the literature on the application of AI to cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and summarizes its advantages. We explore how AI assists cancer diagnosis and prognosis, specifically with regard to its unprecedented accuracy, which is even higher than that of general statistical applications in oncology. We also demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, opportunities and challenges in the clinical implementation of AI are discussed. Hence, this article provides a new perspective on how AI technology can help improve cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and continue improving human health in the future.},

The first two methods illustrated how survival bias could be introduced. Three additional methods were considered to control for this bias. Methods were compared in the context of evaluating statins for secondary prevention in elderly patients post-acute myocardial infarction who initiated statins within 90 days after discharge and those who did not. Method 1 that classified patients into users and nonusers at discharge resulted in an overestimation of the benefit (38% relative risk reduction at 1 year). In method 2, following users from the time of the first prescription and nonusers from a randomly selected time between 0 and 90 days attenuated the effect toward the null (10% relative risk reduction). Method 3 controlled for survival bias by following patients from the end of the 90-day time window; however, it suffered a major loss of statistical efficiency and precision. Method 4 matched prescription time distribution between users and nonusers at cohort entry. Method 5 used a time-dependent variable for treatment initiation. Methods 4 and 5 better controlled for survival bias and yielded similar results, suggesting a 20% risk reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction or death events.},

abstract = {Estimating the risk of relapse for breast cancer patients is necessary, since it affects the choice of treatment. This problem involves analysing data of times to relapse of patients and relating them to prognostic variables. Some of the times to relapse will usually be censored.We investigate various ways of using neural network models to extend traditional statistical models in this situation. Such models are better able to model both non-linear effects of prognostic factors and interactions between them, than linear logistic or Cox regression models. With the dataset used in our study, however, the prediction of the risk of relapse is not significantly improved when using a neural network model. Predicting the risk that a patient will relapse within three years, say, is possible from this data, but not when any relapse will happen.},

Main interest often relies in characterizing the way the response changes in time, and the predictors of that change. Marginal, mixed and transition are frequently considered to be the main models for continuous longitudinal data analysis. These approaches are proposed primarily for balanced longitudinal design. However, in clinic studies, data are usually not balanced and some restrictions are necessary in order to use these models. This paper was motivated by a data set related to longitudinal height measurements in children of HIV-infected mothers that was recorded at the university hospital of the Federal University in Minas Gerais, Brazil. This data set is severely unbalanced. The goal of this paper is to assess the application of continuous longitudinal models for the analysis of unbalanced data set.},

First we identify two model-based consistent estimators for the inverse of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the maximum partial likelihood estimator in the Cox model. We then show that under the assumed model the difference between these two estimators is asymptotically normal with mean zero and with a covariance matrix which can be consistently estimated. Goodness-of-fit tests for the Cox model are constructed based on these asymptotic results. Extensive Monte Carlo studies indicate that the large-sample approximation is appropriate for practical use. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed tests tend to be more powerful than other numerical methods in the literature. Two examples are provided for illustrations.},

We suggest a new method to aggregate survival trees in order to obtain better predictions for breast cancer and lymphoma patients. A set of survival trees based on B bootstrap samples is computed. We define the aggregated Kaplan?Meier curve of a new observation by the Kaplan?Meier curve of all observations identified by the B leaves containing the new observation. The integrated Brier score is used for the evaluation of predictive models. We analyse data of a large trial on node positive breast cancer patients conducted by the German Breast Cancer Study Group and a smaller ?pilot? study on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where prognostic factors are derived from microarray expression values. In addition, simulation experiments underline the predictive power of our proposal. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In this article we propose new time-dependent accuracy summaries based on time-specific versions of sensitivity and specificity calculated over risk sets. We connect the accuracy summaries to a previously proposed global concordance measure, which is a variant of Kendall's tau. In addition, we show how standard Cox regression output can be used to obtain estimates of time-dependent sensitivity and specificity, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Semiparametric estimation methods appropriate for both proportional and nonproportional hazards data are introduced, evaluated in simulations, and illustrated using two familiar survival data sets.},

@article{Wolpert1992,
abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.},

abstract = {Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross- neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementB.M.H. is supported by award Number T32GM007753 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.

Intelligent manufacturing\nrelies upon accurate component and product reliability estimates for\ndetermining warranty costs, as well as optimal maintenance, inspection,\nand replacement schedules. Accelerated life testing is one approach that\nis used for shortening the life of products or components or hastening\ntheir performance degradation with the purpose of obtaining data that\nmay be used to predict device life or performance under normal operating\nconditions. The proportional hazards (PH) model is a non-parametric\nmultiple regression approach for reliability estimation, in which a\nbaseline hazard function is modified multiplicatively by covariates\n(i.e. applied stresses). While the PH model is a distribution-free\napproach, specific assumptions need to be made about the time behavior\nof the hazard rates. A neural network (NN) is particularly useful in\npattern recognition problems that involve capturing and learning complex\nunderlying (but consistent) trends in the data. Neural networks are\nhighly non-linear, and in some cases are capable of producing better\napproximations than multiple regression. This paper reports on the\ncomparison of PH and MN models for the analysis of time-dependent\ndielectric breakdown data for a metal-oxide-semiconductor integrated\ncircuit. In this case, the NN model results in a better fit to the data\nbased upon minimizing the mean square error of the predictions when\nusing failure data from an elevated temperature and voltage to predict\nreliability at a lower temperature and voltage.},

In this paper, we introduce a new method to calculate survival functions using the Multi-Task Logistic Regression (MTLR) model as its base and a deep learning architecture as its core. Based on the Concordance index (C-index) and Brier score, this method outperforms the MTLR in all the experiments disclosed in this paper as well as the Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model when nonlinear dependencies are found.},

abstract = {Algorithmic fairness is an increasingly important field concerned with detecting and mitigating biases in machine learning models. There has been a wealth of literature for algorithmic fairness in regression and classification however there has been little exploration of the field for survival analysis. Survival analysis is the prediction task in which one attempts to predict the probability of an event occurring over time. Survival predictions are particularly important in sensitive settings such as when utilising machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis of patients. In this paper we explore how to utilise existing survival metrics to measure bias with group fairness metrics. We explore this in an empirical experiment with 29 survival datasets and 8 measures. We find that measures of discrimination are able to capture bias well whereas there is less clarity with measures of calibration and scoring rules. We suggest further areas for research including prediction-based fairness metrics for distribution predictions.},

abstract = {Discrimination measures for continuous time-to-event outcomes have become an important tool in medical decision making. The idea behind discrimination measures is to evaluate the performance of a prediction model by measuring its ability to distinguish between observations having an event and those having no event. Researchers proposed a variety of approaches to estimate discrimination measures from a set of right-censored data. These approaches rely on different regularity assumptions that are needed to ensure consistency of the respective estimators. Typical examples of regularity assumptions include the proportional hazards assumption in Cox regression and the random censoring assumption. Because regularity assumptions are often violated in practice, conducting a sensitivity analysis of the estimators is of considerable interest. The aim of the paper is to analyze and to compare the most popular estimators of discrimination measures for event time outcomes. On the basis of the results of an extensive simulation study and the analysis of molecular data, we investigate the behavior of the estimators in situations where the underlying regularity assumptions do not hold. We show that violations of the regularity assumptions may induce a nonignorable bias and may therefore result in biased medical decision making.},

abstract = {Summary.? Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

abstract = {The goals of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs are to maximally reduce cases and deaths, and to limit the amount of time required under lockdown. Using a mathematical model calibrated to data from King County Washington but generalizable across states, we simulated multiple scenarios with different vaccine efficacy profiles, vaccination rates, and case thresholds for triggering and relaxing partial lockdowns. We assumed that a contagious variant is currently present at low levels. In all scenarios, it rapidly becomes dominant by early summer. Low case thresholds for triggering partial lockdowns during current and future waves of infection strongly predict lower total numbers of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in 2021. However, in regions with relatively higher current seroprevalence, there is a predicted delay in onset of a subsequent surge in new variant infections. For all vaccine efficacy profiles, increasing vaccination rate lowers the total number of infections and deaths, as well as the total number of days under partial lockdown. Due to variable current estimates of emerging variant infectiousness, vaccine efficacy against these variants, vaccine refusal, and future adherence to masking and physical distancing, we project considerable uncertainty regarding the timing and intensity of subsequent waves of infection. Nevertheless, under all plausible scenarios, rapid vaccination and early implementation of partial lockdown are the two most critical variables to save the greatest number of lives.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementDrs.

abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

The criterion commonly used to measure the ranking quality of a classification algorithm is the area under the ROC curve (AUC). To report it properly, it is crucial to determine an interval of confidence for its value. This paper provides confidence intervals for the AUC based on a statistical and combinatorial analysis using only simple parameters such as the error rate and the number of positive and negative examples. The analysis is distribution-independent, it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The results are of practical use and can be viewed as the equivalent for AUC of the standard confidence intervals given in the case of the error rate. They are comparedwith previous approaches in several standard classification tasks demonstrating the benefits of our analysis. 1},

In general, this finding is consistent with the literature.

abstract = {Objective To promote a more systematic approach to research on uncertainty in health care, and to explore promising starting points and future directions for this research. Methods We examine three fundamental aspects of medical uncertainty that a systematic research program should ideally address: its nature, effects, and communication. We summarize key insights from past empirical research and explore existing conceptual models that can help guide future research. Results A diverse body of past research on medical uncertainty has produced valuable empirical insights and conceptual models that provide useful starting points for future empirical and theoretical work. However, these insights need to be more fully developed and integrated to answer remaining questions about what uncertainty is, how it affects people, and how and why it should be communicated. Conclusion Uncertainty in health care is an extremely important but incompletely understood phenomenon. Improving our understanding of the many important aspects of uncertainty in health care will require a more systematic program of research based upon shared, integrative conceptual models and active, collaborative engagement of the broader research community. Practice Implications A more systematic approach to investigating uncertainty in health care can help elucidate how the clinical communication of uncertainty might be improved.},

abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, now designated Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC) by Public Health England, originated in the UK in late Summer to early Autumn 2020. We examine epidemiological evidence for this VOC having a transmission advantage from several perspectives. First, whole genome sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing provides an indication of changing prevalence of different genetic variants through time. Phylodynamic modelling additionally indicates that genetic diversity of this lineage has changed in a manner consistent with exponential growth. Second, we find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Third, we examine growth trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers at local area level across England, and show that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. Available SGTF data indicate a shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases. Fourth, we assess the association of VOC frequency with independent estimates of the overall SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number through time. Finally, we fit a semi-mechanistic model directly to local VOC and non-VOC case incidence to estimate the reproduction numbers over time for each. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage, with the estimated difference in reproduction numbers between VOC and non-VOC ranging between 0.4 and 0.7, and the ratio of reproduction numbers varying between 1.4 and 1.8. We note that these estimates of transmission advantage apply to a period where high levels of social distancing were in place in England; extrapolation to other transmission contexts therefore requires caution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCOG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and Genome Research Limited, operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

abstract = {Multivariable prognostic models are widely used in cancer and other disease areas, and have a range of applications in clinical medicine, clinical trials and allocation of health services resources. A well-founded and reliable measure of the prognostic ability of a model would be valuable to help define the separation between patients or prognostic groups that the model could provide, and to act as a benchmark of model performance in a validation setting. We propose such a measure for models of survival data. Its motivation derives originally from the idea of separation between Kaplan-Meier curves. We define the criteria for a successful measure and discuss them with respect to our approach. Adjustments for 'optimism', the tendency for a model to predict better on the data on which it was derived than on new data, are suggested. We study the properties of the measure by simulation and by example in three substantial data sets. We believe that our new measure will prove useful as a tool to evaluate the separation available-with a prognostic model.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States, in terms of incidence and mortality. In 2009, it is estimated that more than 150,000 deaths will result from lung cancer alone. Genetic information is an extremely valuable data source in characterizing the personal nature of cancer. Over the past several years, investigators have conducted numerous association studies where intensive genetic data is collected on relatively few patients compared to the numbers of gene predictors, with one scientific goal being to identify genetic features associated with cancer recurrence or survival. In this note, we propose high-dimensional survival analysis through a new application of boosting, a powerful tool in machine learning. Our approach is based on an accelerated lifetime model and minimizing the sum of pairwise differences in residuals. We apply our method to a recent microarray study of lung adenocarcinoma and find that our ensemble is composed of 19 genes, while a proportional hazards (PH) ensemble is composed of nine genes, a proper subset of the 19-gene panel. In one of our simulation scenarios, we demonstrate that PH boosting in a misspecified model tends to underfit and ignore moderately-sized covariate effects, on average. Diagnostic analyses suggest that the PH assumption is not satisfied in the microarray data and may explain, in part, the discrepancy in the sets of active coefficients. Our simulation studies and comparative data analyses demonstrate how statistical learning by PH models alone is insufficient.},

The censoring variable $C$ is allowed to depend on $X$ but it is assumed that $Y$ and $C$ are conditionally independent given $X = x$. The estimate of the bivariate distribution is obtained by averaging estimates of the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X = x$ over a range of values of $x$. The weak convergence of the centered estimator multiplied by $n^{1/2}$ is obtained, and a closed-form expression for the covariance function of the limiting process is given. It is shown that the proposed estimator is optimal in the Beran sense. This is similar to an optimality property the product-limit estimator enjoys. Using the proposed estimator of the bivariate distribution, an extension of the least squares estimator to censored data polynomial regression is obtained and its asymptotic normality established.},

abstract = {This study aims to identify the most and least significant prognostic factors for breast cancer survival analysis by means of feature evaluation indices derived from multilayer feedforward backpropagation neural networks (MLFFBPNN), fuzzy k-nearest neighbour classifier (FK-NN) and a logistic regression-based backward stepwise method (ER). The data used for the survival analysis were collected from 100 women who had been clinically diagnosed with breast disease in the form of carcinoma or benign conditions. The data set consists of seven different histological and cytological prognostic factors and two corresponding outputs to be predicted (whether the patient is alive or dead within 5 years of diagnosis). The MLFFBPNN, FK-NN and LR based indices identified different subsets of the factors as the most significant sets. We therefore suggest that it could be dangerous to rely on one method's outcome for assessment of such factors. It should also be noted that "S-phase fraction" (SPF) is the common cytological factor identified by all three methods while none of the three methods identified another cytological factor, namely "minimum (start) nuclear pleomorphism index" (NPI/sub min/). We, therefore, conclude that "S-phase fraction" and "minimum (start) nuclear pleomorphism index" appear to be the most and least important prognostic factors, respectively, for survival analysis in breast cancer patients, and should be investigated thoroughly in future clinical studies in oncology.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter review and classify uncertainties in clinical medicine. Epistemic uncertainty is intimately linked to the relationship between theory, evidence, and knowledge. The relationships among observed, observable, and unobservable realities express uncertainties that can be characterized as a lack of knowledge about what is known (unknown knowns), what is known to be unknown (known unknowns), and not knowing what is unknown (unknown unknowns). Intimately linked with this classiﬁcation of uncertainty is the psychological taxonomy that categorizes uncertainty based on knowledge of the external world and on our own state of knowledge. It is suggested that any attempt to develop a comprehensive treatise of uncertainty in clinical medicine must take into account the insights obtained from psychological research on uncertainty. Uncertainty can be effectively managed by explicitly recognizing its many sources, improving the quality of medical evidence, using better information technology tools, searching for sources of bias, and applying probability and decision theory to decisions under uncertainty.},

abstract = {The capacity to collect and analyse data is growing exponentially. Referred to as ‘Big Data', this scientific, social and technological trend has helped create destabilising amounts of information, which can challenge accepted social and ethical norms. Big Data remains a fuzzy idea, emerging across social, scientific, and business contexts sometimes seemingly related only by the gigantic size of the datasets being considered. As is often the case with the cutting edge of scientific and technological progress, understanding of the ethical implications of Big Data lags behind. In order to bridge such a gap, this article systematically and comprehensively analyses academic literature concerning the ethical implications of Big Data, providing a watershed for future ethical investigations and regulations. Particular attention is paid to biomedical Big Data due to the inherent sensitivity of medical information. By means of a meta-analysis of the literature, a thematic narrative is provided to guide ethicists, data scientists, regulators and other stakeholders through what is already known or hypothesised about the ethical risks of this emerging and innovative phenomenon. Five key areas of concern are identified: (1) informed consent, (2) privacy (including anonymisation and data protection), (3) ownership, (4) epistemology and objectivity, and (5) ‘Big Data Divides' created between those who have or lack the necessary resources to analyse increasingly large datasets. Critical gaps in the treatment of these themes are identified with suggestions for future research. Six additional areas of concern are then suggested which, although related have not yet attracted extensive debate in the existing literature. It is argued that they will require much closer scrutiny in the immediate future: (6) the dangers of ignoring group-level ethical harms; (7) the importance of epistemology in assessing the ethics of Big Data; (8) the changing nature of fiduciary relationships that become increasingly data saturated; (9) the need to distinguish between ‘academic' and ‘commercial' Big Data practices in terms of potential harm to data subjects; (10) future problems with ownership of intellectual property generated from analysis of aggregated datasets; and (11) the difficulty of providing meaningful access rights to individual data subjects that lack necessary resources. Considered together, these eleven themes provide a thorough critical framework to guide ethical assessment and governance of emerging Big Data practices.},

abstract = {The hazard ratio (HR) is the most common measure of treatment effect in clinical trials that use time-to-event outcomes such as survival. When survival curves cross over or separate only after a considerable time, the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model is violated, and HR can be misleading. We present two measures of treatment effects for situations where the HR changes over time: the life expectancy difference (LED) and life expectancy ratio (LER). LED is the difference between mean survival times in the intervention and control arms. LER is the ratio of these two times. LED and LER can be calculated for at least two time intervals during the trial, allowing for curves where the treatment effect changes over time. The two measures are readily interpretable as absolute and relative gains or losses in life expectancy.

With this motivation, we address this issue and provide a new survival analysis framework using deep learning and active learning with a novel sampling strategy. First, our approach provides better representation with lower dimensions from clinical features using labeled (time-to-event) and unlabeled (censored) instances and then actively trains the survival model by labeling the censored data using an oracle. As a clinical assistive tool, we introduce a simple effective treatment recommendation approach based on our survival model. In the experimental study, we apply our approach on SEER-Medicare data related to prostate cancer among African–Americans and white patients. The results indicate that our approach outperforms significantly than baseline models.},

We show how the back-propagation algorithm may be used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates in certain standard regression models for survival data, as well as in various generalizations of these. Examples concerning malignant melanoma and post-partum amenorrhoea during lactation are used as illustration. We conclude that although problems with the substantial number of parameters and their interpretation remain, the feed-forward neural network models are flexible extensions to the standard regression models and thereby candidates for use in prediction and exploratory analyses in larger data sets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Cox Proportional Hazard model is the most popular technique to analysis the effects of covariates on survival time but under certain circumstances parametric models may offer advantages over Cox's model. In this study we use Cox regression and alternative parametric models such as: Weibull, Exponential and Lognormal models to evaluate prognostic factors affecting survival of patients with stomach cancer. Comparisons were made to find the best model. METHODS: To determine independent prognostic factors reducing survival time for stomach cancer, we compared parametric and semi-parametric methods applied to patients who registered in one cancer registry center located in southern Iran using the Akaike Information Criterion. RESULTS: Of a total of 442 patients, 266 (60.2%) died. The results of data analysis using Cox and parametric models were approximately similar. Patients with ages 60-75 and >75 years at diagnosis had an increased risk for death followed by those with poor differentiated grade and presence of distant metastasis (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Although the Hazard Ratios in the Cox model and parametric ones are approximately similar, according to Akaike Information Criterion, the Weibull and Exponential models are the most favorable for survival analysis.},

The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs. Now on {CD}, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! Use the contents of the {CD} to create your own design documents and reusable components. The {CD} contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard {HTML} format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on {CD}-{ROM}. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process.

abstract = {Multi-omics data, that is, datasets containing different types of high-dimensional molecular variables, are increasingly often generated for the investigation of various diseases. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the usefulness of multi-omics data for the prediction of disease outcomes such as survival time. It is also unclear which methods are most appropriate to derive such prediction models. We aim to give some answers to these questions through a large-scale benchmark study using real data. Different prediction methods from machine learning and statistics were applied on 18 multi-omics cancer datasets (35 to 1000 observations, up to 100 000 variables) from the database ‘The Cancer Genome Atlas' (TCGA). The considered outcome was the (censored) survival time. Eleven methods based on boosting, penalized regression and random forest were compared, comprising both methods that do and that do not take the group structure of the omics variables into account. The Kaplan–Meier estimate and a Cox model using only clinical variables were used as reference methods. The methods were compared using several repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation. Uno's C-index and the integrated Brier score served as performance metrics. The results indicate that methods taking into account the multi-omics structure have a slightly better prediction performance. Taking this structure into account can protect the predictive information in low-dimensional groups—especially clinical variables—from not being exploited during prediction. Moreover, only the block forest method outperformed the Cox model on average, and only slightly. This indicates, as a by-product of our study, that in the considered TCGA studies the utility of multi-omics data for prediction purposes was limited.

If this process is not adequately controlled, overfitting may result in serious overoptimism leading to potentially erroneous conclusions.Methods: For right censored time-to-event data, we estimate the prediction error for assessing the performance of a risk prediction model (Gerds and Schumacher, 2006; Graf et al., 1999). Furthermore, resampling methods are used to detect overfitting and resulting overoptimism and to adjust the estimates of prediction error (Gerds and Schumacher, 2007).Results: We show how and to what extent the methodology can be used in situations characterized by a large number of potential predictor variables where overfitting may be expected to be overwhelming. This is illustrated by estimating the prediction error of some recently proposed techniques for fitting a multivariate Cox regression model applied to the data of a prognostic study in patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Availability: Resampling-based estimation of prediction error curves is implemented in an R package called pec available from the authors.Contact:sec@imbi.uni-freiburg.de},

abstract = {Abstract Identification of key factors associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and quantification of this risk using multivariable prediction algorithms are among the major advances made in preventive cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology in the 20th century. The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {CXC ligand 17 (CXCL17) is a novel CXC chemokine whose clinical significance remains largely unknown. In the present study, we characterized the prognostic value of CXCL17 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and evaluated the association of CXCL17 with immune infiltration. We examined CXCL17 expression in 227 HCC tissue specimens by immunohistochemical staining, and correlated CXCL17 expression patterns with clinicopathological features, prognosis, and immune infiltrate density (CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, neutrophils, macrophages). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that both increased intratumoral CXCL17 (P = 0.015 for overall survival [OS], P = 0.003 for recurrence-free survival [RFS]) and peritumoral CXCL17 (P = 0.002 for OS, P<0.001 for RFS) were associated with shorter OS and RFS. Patients in the CXCL17low group had significantly lower 5-year recurrence rate compared with patients in the CXCL17high group (peritumoral: 53.1% vs. 77.7%, P<0.001, intratumoral: 58.6% vs. 73.0%, P = 0.001, respectively). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified peritumoral CXCL17 as an independent prognostic factor for both OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.066, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.296–3.292, P = 0.002) and RFS (HR = 1.844, 95% CI = 1.218–2.793, P = 0.004). Moreover, CXCL17 expression was associated with more CD68 and less CD4 cell infiltration (both P<0.05). The combination of CXCL17 density and immune infiltration could be used to further classify patients into subsets with different prognosis for RFS. Our results provide the first evidence that tumor-infiltrating CXCL17+ cell density is an independent prognostic factor that predicts both OS and RFS in HCC. CXCL17 production correlated with adverse immune infiltration and might be an important target for anti-HCC therapies.},

abstract = {Prognostic models incorporating survival analysis predict the risk (i.e., probability) of experiencing a future event over a specific time period. In 2002, Royston and Parmar described a type of flexible parametric survival model called the Royston-Parmar model in Statistics in Medicine, a model which fits a restricted cubic spline to flexibly model the baseline log cumulative hazard on the proportional hazards scale. This feature permits absolute measures of effect (e.g., hazard rates) to be estimated at all time points, an important feature when using the model. The Royston-Parmar model can also incorporate time-dependent effects and be used on different scales (e.g., proportional odds, probit). These features make the Royston-Parmar model attractive for prediction, yet their current uptake for prognostic modeling is unknown. Thus, the objectives were to conduct a scoping review of how the Royston-Parmar model has been applied to prognostic models in health research, to raise awareness of the model, to identify gaps in current reporting, and to offer model building considerations and reporting suggestions for other researchers. Five electronic databases and gray literature indexed in web sources from 2001 to 2016 were searched to identify articles for inclusion in the scoping review. Two reviewers independently screened 1429 articles, and after applying exclusion criteria through a two-step screening process, data from 12 studies were abstracted. Since 2001, only 12 studies were identified that used the Royston-Parmar model in some capacity for prognostic modeling, 10 of which used the model as the basis for their prognostic model. The restricted cubic spline varied across studies in the number of interior knots (range 1 to 6), and only three studies reported knot placement. Three studies provided details about the baseline function, with two studies using a figure and the third providing coefficients. However, no studies provided adequate information on their restricted cubic spline to permit others to validate or completely use the model. Despite the advantages of the Royston-Parmar model for prognostic models, they are not widely used in health research. Better reporting of details about the restricted cubic spline is needed, so the prognostic model can be used and validated by others. The protocol was registered with Open Science Framework (

abstract = {The usual method of estimating survival probabilities, namely the Kaplan-Meier method, is suboptimal in the analysis of deaths on the transplant waiting list. Death, transplantation, and withdrawal from list must all be considered. In this analysis, we applied the competing risk analysis method, which allows evaluating these end points individually and simultaneously, to compare the risk of waiting list death across era, blood types, liver disease diagnosis, and severity (Model for End-stage Liver Disease; MELD). Of 861 patients registered on the waiting list at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1990 and 1999, 657 (76%) patients underwent transplantation, 82 (10%) died while waiting, 41 (5%) withdrew from the list, and 81 (9%) patients were still waiting as of February 2002. The risk of death at 3 years was 10% by the competing risk analysis. During the study period, the median time to transplantation increased from 45 to 517 days. In univariate analyses, there was no significant difference in the risk of death by era of listing (P = .25) or blood type (P = .31), whereas the risk of death was significantly higher in patients with alcohol-induced liver disease and those with higher MELD score (P < .01). A multivariable analysis showed that after adjusting for MELD, blood type, and diagnosis, patients listed in the latter era had higher mortality. In conclusion, the competing risk analysis method is useful in estimating the risk of death among patients awaiting liver transplantation.},

abstract = {The development of molecular signatures for the prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a methodologically challenging task in bioinformatics and biostatistics. Although there are numerous approaches for the derivation of marker combinations and their evaluation, the underlying methodology often suffers from the problem that different optimization criteria are mixed during the feature selection, estimation and evaluation steps. This might result in marker combinations that are suboptimal regarding the evaluation criterion of interest. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework to derive and evaluate biomarker combinations. Our approach is based on the concordance index for time-to-event data, which is a non-parametric measure to quantify the discriminatory power of a prediction rule. Specifically, we propose a gradient boosting algorithm that results in linear biomarker combinations that are optimal with respect to a smoothed version of the concordance index. We investigate the performance of our algorithm in a large-scale simulation study and in two molecular data sets for the prediction of survival in breast cancer patients. Our numerical results show that the new approach is not only methodologically sound but can also lead to a higher discriminatory power than traditional approaches for the derivation of gene signatures.},

@article{Gensheimer2018,
abstract = {There is currently great interest in applying neural networks to prediction tasks in medicine. It is important for predictive models to be able to use survival data, where each patient has a known follow-up time and event/censoring indicator. This avoids information loss when training the model and enables generation of predicted survival curves. In this paper, we describe a discrete-time survival model that is designed to be used with neural networks. The model is trained with the maximum likelihood method using minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The use of SGD enables rapid training speed. The model is flexible, so that the baseline hazard rate and the effect of the input data can vary with follow-up time. It has been implemented in the Keras deep learning framework, and source code for the model and several examples is available online. We demonstrated the high performance of the model by using it as part of a convolutional neural network to predict survival for over 10,000 patients with metastatic cancer, using the full text of 1,137,317 provider notes. The model's C-index on the validation set was 0.71, which was superior to a linear baseline model (C-index 0.69).},

abstract = {This article reviews five approximate statistical tests for determining whether one learning algorithm outperforms another on a particular learning task. These test sare compared experimentally to determine their probability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type I error). Two widely used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of type I error in certain situations and should never be used: a test for the difference of two proportions and a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train-test splits. A third test, a paired-differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of type I error. A fourth test, McNemar's test, is shown to have low type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5 × 2 cv, based on five iterations of twofold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has acceptable type I error. The article also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The cross-validated t test is the most powerful. The 5×2 cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than McNemar's test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, Mc-Nemar's test is the only test with acceptable type I error. For algorithms that can be executed 10 times, the 5 × 2 cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set.},

@article{Hernandez2012,
abstract = {Many performance metrics have been introduced in the literature for the evaluation of classification performance, each of them with different origins and areas of application. These metrics include accuracy, unweighted accuracy, the area under the ROC curve or the ROC convex hull, the mean absolute error and the Brier score or mean squared error (with its decomposition into refinement and calibration). One way of understanding the relations among these metrics is by means of variable operating conditions (in the form of misclassification costs and/or class distributions). Thus, a metric may correspond to some expected loss over different operating conditions. One dimension for the analysis has been the distribution for this range of operating conditions, leading to some important connections in the area of proper scoring rules. We demonstrate in this paper that there is an equally important dimension which has so far received much less attention in the analysis of performance metrics. This dimension is given by the decision rule, which is typically implemented as a threshold choice method when using scoring models. In this paper, we explore many old and new threshold choice methods: fixed, score-uniform, score-driven, rate-driven and optimal, among others. By calculating the expected loss obtained with these threshold choice methods for a uniform range of operating conditions we give clear interpretations of the 0-1 loss, the absolute error, the Brier score, the AUC and the refinement loss respectively. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of performance metrics as well as a systematic approach to loss minimisation which can be summarised as follows: given a model, apply the threshold choice methods that correspond with the available information about the operating condition, and compare their expected losses. In order to assist in this procedure we also derive several connections between the aforementioned performance metrics, and we highlight the role of calibration in choosing the threshold choice method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Jose Hernandez-Orallo, Peter Flach and Cesar Ferri.},

While many sources of uncertainty may exist, they are generally categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by refining models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to thus categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce dependence among random events, which may not be properly noted if the character of uncertainties is not correctly modeled. Influences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codified design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the influence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliability problems.},

abstract = {Machine learning techniques have recently received considerable attention, especially when used for the construction of prediction models from data. Despite their potential advantages over standard statistical methods, like their ability to model non-linear relationships and construct symbolic and interpretable models, their applications to survival analysis are at best rare, primarily because of the difficulty to appropriately handle censored data. In this paper we propose a schema that enables the use of classification methods--including machine learning classifiers--for survival analysis. To appropriately consider the follow-up time and censoring, we propose a technique that, for the patients for which the event did not occur and have short follow-up times, estimates their probability of event and assigns them a distribution of outcome accordingly. Since most machine learning techniques do not deal with outcome distributions, the schema is implemented using weighted examples. To show the utility of the proposed technique, we investigate a particular problem of building prognostic models for prostate cancer recurrence, where the sole prediction of the probability of event (and not its probability dependency on time) is of interest. A case study on preoperative and postoperative prostate cancer recurrence prediction shows that by incorporating this weighting technique the machine learning tools stand beside modern statistical methods and may, by inducing symbolic recurrence models, provide further insight to relationships within the modeled data.},

abstract = {This paper studies the task of learning transformation models for ranking problems, ordinal regression and survival analysis. The present contribution describes a machine learning approach termed MINLIP. The key insight is to relate ranking criteria as the Area Under the Curve to monotone transformation functions. Consequently, the notion of a Lipschitz smoothness constant is found to be useful for complexity control for learning transformation models, much in a similar vein as the 'margin' is for Support Vector Machines for classification. The use of this model structure in the context of high dimensional data, as well as for estimating non-linear, and additive models based on primal-dual kernel machines, and for sparse models is indicated. Given n observations, the present method solves a quadratic program existing of O(n) constraints and O(n) unknowns, where most existing risk minimization approaches to ranking problems typically result in algorithms with O(n2) constraints or unknowns. We specify the MINLIP method for three different cases: the first one concerns the preference learning problem. Secondly it is specified how to adapt the method to ordinal regression with a finite set of ordered outcomes. Finally, it is shown how the method can be used in the context of survival analysis where one models failure times, typically subject to censoring. The current approach is found to be particularly useful in this context as it can handle, in contrast with the standard statistical model for analyzing survival data, all types of censoring in a straightforward way, and because of the explicit relation with the Proportional Hazard and Accelerated Failure Time models. The advantage of the current method is illustrated on different benchmark data sets, as well as for estimating a model for cancer survival based on different micro-array and clinical data sets.},

abstract = {<p>As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progressed, distinct variants emerged and dominated in England. These variants, Wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron were characterized by variations in transmissibility and severity. We used a robust mathematical model and Bayesian inference framework to analyse epidemiological surveillance data from England. We quantified the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), therapeutics, and vaccination on virus transmission and severity. Each successive variant had a higher intrinsic transmissibility. Omicron (BA.1) had the highest basic reproduction number at 8.3 (95% credible interval (CrI) 7.7-8.8). Varying levels of NPIs were crucial in controlling virus transmission until population immunity accumulated. Immune escape properties of Omicron decreased effective levels of immunity in the population by a third. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies, we found Alpha had the highest basic infection fatality ratio (2.9%, 95% CrI 2.7-3.2), followed by Delta (2.2%, 95% CrI 2.0–2.4), Wildtype (1.2%, 95% CrI 1.1–1.2), and Omicron (0.7%, 95% CrI 0.6-0.8). Our findings highlight the importance of continued surveillance. Long-term strategies for monitoring and maintaining effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 are critical to inform the role of NPIs to effectively manage future variants with potentially higher intrinsic transmissibility and severe outcomes.</p>},

abstract = {This handbook explores the topic of death and dying from the late twentieth to the early twenty-first centuries, with particular emphasis on the United States. In this period, technology has radically changed medical practices and the way we die as structures of power have been reshaped by the rights claims of African Americans, women, gays, students, and, most relevant here, patients. Respecting patients' values has been recognized as the essential moral component of clinical decision making. Technology's promise has been seen to have a dark side: it prolongs the dying process. For the first time in history, human beings have the ability to control the timing of death. With this ability comes a responsibility that is awesome and inescapable. How we understand and manage this responsibility is the theme of this volume. The book has six sections. Section I examines how the law has helped shape clinical practice, emphasizing the roles of rights and patient autonomy. Section II focuses on specific clinical issues, including death and dying in children, continuous sedation as a way to relieve suffering at the end of life, and the problem of prognostication in patients who are thought to be dying. Section III considers psychosocial and cultural issues. Section IV discusses death and dying among various vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and persons with disabilities. Section V deals with physician-assisted suicide and active euthanasia (lethal injection). Finally, Section VI looks at hospice and palliative care as ways to address the psychosocial and ethical problems of death and dying.},

In this paper, we consider semiparametric varying-coefficient accelerated failure time models for right censored survival data with high-dimensional covariates. Instead of adopting the traditional regularization approaches, we offer a novel sparse boosting (SparseL2Boosting) algorithm to conduct model-based prediction and variable selection. One main advantage of this new method is that we do not need to perform the time-consuming selection of tuning parameters. Extensive simulations are conducted to examine the performance of our sparse boosting feature selection techniques. We further illustrate our methods using a lung cancer data analysis.},

Levamisole plus 5-FU, and to a lesser extent levamisole alone, reduced cancer recurrence in comparison with no adjuvant therapy. These differences, after correction for imbalances in prognostic variables, were only suggestive for levamisole alone (P = .05) but quite significant for levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .003). Whereas both treatment regimens were associated with overall improvements in survival, these improvements reached borderline significance only for stage C patients treated with levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .03). Therapy was clinically tolerable with either regimen and severe toxicity was uncommon. These promising results have led to a large national intergroup confirmatory trial currently in progress.},

abstract = {Due to rapid developments in machine learning, and in particular neural networks, a number of new methods for time-to-event predictions have been developed in the last few years. As neural networks are parametric models, it is more straightforward to integrate parametric survival models in the neural network framework than the popular semi-parametric Cox model. In particular, discrete-time survival models, which are fully parametric, are interesting candidates to extend with neural networks. The likelihood for discrete-time survival data may be parameterized by the probability mass function (PMF) or by the discrete hazard rate, and both of these formulations have been used to develop neural network-based methods for time-to-event predictions. In this paper, we review and compare these approaches. More importantly, we show how the discrete-time methods may be adopted as approximations for continuous-time data. To this end, we introduce two discretization schemes, corresponding to equidistant times or equidistant marginal survival probabilities, and two ways of interpolating the discrete-time predictions, corresponding to piecewise constant density functions or piecewise constant hazard rates. Through simulations and study of real-world data, the methods based on the hazard rate parametrization are found to perform slightly better than the methods that use the PMF parametrization. Inspired by these investigations, we also propose a continuous-time method by assuming that the continuous-time hazard rate is piecewise constant. The method, named PC-Hazard, is found to be highly competitive with the aforementioned methods in addition to other methods for survival prediction found in the literature.},

In this paper, we propose a novel support vector technique (named SVCR) for regression on censored targets. SVCR inherits the strengths of support vector methods, such as a globally optimal solution by convex programming, fast training speed and strong generalization capacity. In contrast to ranking approaches to survival analysis, our approach is able not only to achieve superior ordering performance, but also to predict the survival time very well. Experiments show a significant performance improvement when the majority of the training data is censored. Experimental results on several survival analysis datasets demonstrate that SVCR is very competitive against classical survival analysis models.},

A simulation study shows that marker-dependent censoring can lead to important biases for the ROC estimators not adapted to this case. A slight modification of the inverse probability of censoring weighting estimators proposed by Uno et al. (2007) and Hung and Chiang (2010a) performs as well as the nearest neighbor estimator of Heagerty et al. (2000) in the simulation study and has interesting practical properties. Finally, the estimators were used to evaluate abilities of a marker combining age and a cognitive test to predict dementia in the elderly. Data were obtained from the French PAQUID cohort. The censoring appears clearly marker-dependent leading to appreciable differences between ROC curves estimated with the different methods.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare and evaluate ranking, regression and combined machine learning approaches for the analysis of survival data. Methods: The literature describes two approaches based on support vector machines to deal with censored observations. In the first approach the key idea is to rephrase the task as a ranking problem via the concordance index, a problem which can be solved efficiently in a context of structural risk minimization and convex optimization techniques. In a second approach, one uses a regression approach, dealing with censoring by means of inequality constraints. The goal of this paper is then twofold: (i) introducing a new model combining the ranking and regression strategy, which retains the link with existing survival models such as the proportional hazards model via transformation models; and (ii) comparison of the three techniques on 6 clinical and 3 high-dimensional datasets and discussing the relevance of these techniques over classical approaches fur survival data. Results: We compare svm-based survival models based on ranking constraints, based on regression constraints and models based on both ranking and regression constraints. The performance of the models is compared by means of three different measures: (i) the concordance index, measuring the model's discriminating ability; (ii) the logrank test statistic, indicating whether patients with a prognostic index lower than the median prognostic index have a significant different survival than patients with a prognostic index higher than the median; and (iii) the hazard ratio after normalization to restrict the prognostic index between 0 and 1. Our results indicate a significantly better performance for models including regression constraints above models only based on ranking constraints. Conclusions: This work gives empirical evidence that svm-based models using regression constraints perform significantly better than svm-based models based on ranking constraints. Our experiments show a comparable performance for methods including only regression or both regression and ranking constraints on clinical data. On high dimensional data, the former model performs better. However, this approach does not have a theoretical link with standard statistical models for survival data. This link can be made by means of transformation models when ranking constraints are included. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cancer is an aggressive disease with a low median survival rate. Ironically, the treatment process is long and very costly due to its high recurrence and mortality rates. Accurate early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of cancer are essential to enhance the patient's survival rate. Developments in statistics and computer engineering over the years have encouraged many scientists to apply computational methods such as multivariate statistical analysis to analyze the prognosis of the disease, and the accuracy of such analyses is significantly higher than that of empirical predictions. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning and deep learning, has found popular applications in clinical cancer research in recent years, cancer prediction performance has reached new heights. This article reviews the literature on the application of AI to cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and summarizes its advantages. We explore how AI assists cancer diagnosis and prognosis, specifically with regard to its unprecedented accuracy, which is even higher than that of general statistical applications in oncology. We also demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, opportunities and challenges in the clinical implementation of AI are discussed. Hence, this article provides a new perspective on how AI technology can help improve cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and continue improving human health in the future.},

“If I have a seriously ill relative, I want a reliable assessment of their chances of survival - not a spuriously precise prediction, nor some vague, reassuring platitude”


And yet this is precisely what you get when you have a seriously ill relative. Whilst it may seem that a prognostication of “5-year survival has a survival rate of X%”, what does this percentage actually mean? Is it some proportion? If so for which people over which time-frame, how often is it updated? Machine learning? Personal predictions? etc.},

abstract = {Survival analysis with cohort study data has been traditionally performed using Cox proportional hazards models. Random survival forests (RSFs), a machine learning method, now present an alternative method. Using the UK Women's Cohort Study (n = 34,493) we evaluate two methods: a Cox model and an RSF, to investigate the association between Body Mass Index and time to breast cancer incidence. Robustness of the models were assessed by cross validation and bootstraping. Histograms of bootstrap coefficients are reported. C-Indices and Integrated Brier Scores are reported for all models. In post-menopausal women, the Cox model Hazard Ratios (HR) for Overweight (OW) and Obese (O) were 1.25 (1.04, 1.51) and 1.28 (0.98, 1.68) respectively and the RSF Odds Ratios (OR) with partial dependence on menopause for OW and O were 1.34 (1.31, 1.70) and 1.45 (1.42, 1.48). HR are non-significant results. Only the RSF appears confident about the effect of weight status on time to event. Bootstrapping demonstrated Cox model coefficients can vary significantly, weakening interpretation potential. An RSF was used to produce partial dependence plots (PDPs) showing OW and O weight status increase the probability of breast cancer incidence in post-menopausal women. All models have relatively low C-Index and high Integrated Brier Score. The RSF overfits the data. In our study, RSF can identify complex non-proportional hazard type patterns in the data, and allow more complicated relationships to be investigated using PDPs, but it overfits limiting extrapolation of results to new instances. Moreover, it is less easily interpreted than Cox models. The value of survival analysis remains paramount and therefore machine learning techniques like RSF should be considered as another method for analysis.},

abstract = {Objective To conduct a scoping review of existing studies that examine communication strategies that address uncertainty in health and categorize them using the taxonomy of uncertainty. Methods Relevant articles retrieved from ten databases were categorized according to the dimensions of the taxonomy of uncertainty, and study characteristics were extracted from each article. Results All articles (n = 63) explored uncertainty in the context of probabilistic risk and related to scientific issues (n = 63; 100%). The majority focused on complexity (n = 24; 38.1%) and uncertainty experienced by patients (n = 52; 82.5%). Most utilized quantitative methods (n = 46; 73.0%), hypothetical scenarios (n = 49; 77.8%), and focused on cancer (n = 20; 31.7%). Theory guided messages and study design in fewer than half (n = 27; 42.9%). Conclusions Heterogeneity in terminology used to refer to different types of uncertainties preclude a unified research agenda on uncertainty communication. Research predominately focuses on probability as the source of uncertainty, uncertainties related to scientific issues, and uncertainty experienced by patients. Practice implications Additional efforts are needed to understand providers' experience of uncertainty, and to identify strategies to address ambiguity. Future studies should use consistent terminology to allow for coherence and advancement of uncertainty communication scholarship. Continued efforts to refine the existing taxonomy should be undertaken.},

abstract = {Survival analysis is an important field of Statistics concerned with mak- ing time-to-event predictions with ‘censored' data. Machine learning, specifically supervised learning, is the field of Statistics concerned with using state-of-the-art algorithms in order to make predictions on unseen data. This thesis looks at unifying these two fields as current research into the two is still disjoint, with ‘classical survival' on one side and su- pervised learning (primarily classification and regression) on the other. This PhD aims to improve the quality of machine learning research in survival analysis by focusing on transparency, accessibility, and predic- tive performance in model building and evaluation. This is achieved by examining historic and current proposals and implementations for models and measures (both classical and machine learning) in survival analysis and making novel contributions. In particular this includes: i) a survey of survival models including a crit- ical and technical survey of almost all supervised learning model classes currently utilised in survival, as well as novel adaptations; ii) a survey of evaluation measures for survival models, including key definitions, proofs and theorems for survival scoring rules that had previously been missing from the literature; iii) introduction and formalisation of composition and reduction in survival analysis, with a view on increasing transparency of modelling strategies and improving predictive performance; iv) imple- mentation of several R software packages, in particular mlr3proba for machine learning in survival analysis; and v) the first large-scale bench- mark experiment on right-censored time-to-event data with 24 survival models and 66 datasets. Survival analysis has many important applications in medical statistics, engineering and finance, and as such requires the same level of rigour as other machine learning fields such as regression and classification; this thesis aims to make this clear by describing a framework from prediction and evaluation to implementation.},

Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1, acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7–2.4-fold more transmissible, and that previous (non-P.1) infection provides 54–79% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coher- entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven- tions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attri- bution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

abstract = {Problem: Evidence is quantified by statistical methods such as p-values and Bayesian posterior probabilities in a routine way despite the fact that there is no consensus about the meanings and implications of these approaches. A high level of confusion about these methods can be observed among students, researchers and even professional statisticians. How can a constructivist view of mathematical models and reality help to resolve the confusion? Method: Considerations about the foundations of statistics and probability are revisited with a constructivist attitude that explores which ways of thinking about the modelled phenomena are implied by different approaches to probability modelling. Results: The understanding of the implications of probability modelling for the quantification of evidence can be strongly improved by accepting that whether models are “true” or not cannot be checked from the data, and the use of the models should rather be justified and critically discussed in terms of their implications for the thinking and communication of researchers. Implications: Some useful questions that researchers can use as guidelines when deciding which approach and which model to choose are listed in the paper, along with some implications of using frequentist p-values or Bayesian posterior probability, which can help to address the questions. It is the – far too often ignored – responsibility of the researchers to decide which model is chosen and what the evidence suggests rather than letting the results decide themselves in an “objective way.”},

abstract = {Despite their long history, parametric survival-time models have largely been neglected in the modern biostatistical and medical literature in favour of the Cox proportional hazards model. Here, I present a case for the use of the lognormal distribution in the analysis of survival times of breast and ovarian cancer patients, specifically in modelling the effects of prognostic factors. The lognormal provides a completely specified probability distribution for the observations and a sensible estimate of the variation explained by the model, a quantity that is controversial for the Cox model. I show how imputation of censored observations under the model may be used to inspect the data using familiar graphical and other technques. Results from the Cox and lognormal models are compared and shown apparently to differ to some extent. However, it is hard to judge which model gives the more accurate estimates. It is concluded that provided the lognormal model fits the data adequately, it may be a useful approach to the analysis of censored survival data.},

abstract = {A crucial challenge in predictive modeling for survival analysis is managing censored observations in the data. The Cox proportional hazards model is the standard tool for the analysis of continuous censored survival data. We propose a novel machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Regression for Censored Data (SVRc) for improved analysis of medical survival data. SVRc leverages the high-dimensional capabilities of traditional SVR while adapting it for use with censored data through a modified asymmetric loss/penalty function which allows censored (left and right censored) data to be processed. We applied the new algorithm to predict the recurrence and disease progression of prostate cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. Compared with the traditional Cox model, SVRc achieves significant improvement in overall accuracy as well as in the ability to identify high-risk and low-risk patient populations},

abstract = {Motivation: An important area of research in the postgenomics era is to relate high-dimensional genetic or genomic data to various clinical phenotypes of patients. Due to large variability in time to certain clinical events among patients, studying possibly censored survival phenotypes can be more informative than treating the phenotypes as categorical variables. Due to high dimensionality and censoring, building a predictive model for time to event is more difficult than the classification/linear regression problem. We propose to develop a boosting procedure using smoothing splines for estimating the general proportional hazards models. Such a procedure can potentially be used for identifying non-linear effects of genes on the risk of developing an event.Results: Our empirical simulation studies showed that the procedure can indeed recover the true functional forms of the covariates and can identify important variables that are related to the risk of an event. Results from predicting survival after chemotherapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for identifying important genes that are related to time to death due to cancer and for building a parsimonious model for predicting the survival of future patients. In addition, there is clear evidence of non-linear effects of some genes on survival time.Contact:hli@ucdavis.edu},

Maximally selected rank statistics allow the evaluation of cutpoints, which provide the classification of observations into two groups by a continuous or ordinal predictor variable. The computation of the exact distribution of a maximally selected rank statistic is discussed and a new lower bound of the distribution is derived based on an extension of an algorithm for the exact distribution of a linear rank statistic. Therefore, the test based on the upper bound of the P-value is of level $\alpha$. For small to moderate sample sizes the lower bound of the exact distribution is a substantial improvement compared to approximations based on an improved Bonferroni inequality or based on the asymptotic Gaussian process. The lower bound of the distribution is compared to the exact distribution by means of a simulation study and the proposal is illustrated by three clinical studies.},

In particular, feed-forward neural networks have been used extensively, often accompanied by exaggerated statements of their potential. In this paper, the essentials of feed-forward neural networks and their statistical counterparts (that is, logistic regression models) are reviewed. We point out that the uncritical use of ANNs may lead to serious problems, such as the fitting of implausible functions to describe the probability of class membership and the underestimation of misclassification probabilities. In applications of ANNs to survival data, further difficulties arise. Finally, the results of a search in the medical literature from 1991 to 1995 on applications of ANNs in oncology and some important common mistakes are reported. It is concluded that there is no evidence so far that application of ANNs represents real progress in the field of diagnosis and prognosis in oncology. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Clinical next-generation sequencing (CNGS) is introducing new opportunities and challenges into the practice of medicine. Simultaneously, these technologies are generating uncertainties of an unprecedented scale that laboratories, clinicians, and patients are required to address and manage. We describe in this report the conceptual design of a new taxonomy of uncertainties around the use of CNGS in health care. METHODS: Interviews to delineate the dimensions of uncertainty in CNGS were conducted with genomics experts and themes were extracted in order to expand on a previously published three-dimensional taxonomy of medical uncertainty. In parallel, we developed an interactive website to disseminate the CNGS taxonomy to researchers and engage them in its continued refinement. RESULTS: The proposed taxonomy divides uncertainty along three axes-source, issue, and locus-and further discriminates the uncertainties into five layers with multiple domains. Using a hypothetical clinical example, we illustrate how the taxonomy can be applied to findings from CNGS and used to guide stakeholders through interpretation and implementation of variant results. CONCLUSION: The utility of the proposed taxonomy lies in promoting consistency in describing dimensions of uncertainty in publications and presentations, to facilitate research design and management of the uncertainties inherent in the implementation of CNGS.Genet Med advance online publication 19 January 2017.},

With the re-gaining popularity of artificial neural networks, we asked if a refined neural network model could be used to predict patient survival, as an alternative to the conventional methods, such as Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH) methods with LASSO or ridge penalization. To this end, we have developed a neural network extension of the Cox regression model, called Cox-nnet. It is optimized for survival prediction from high throughput gene expression data, with comparable or better performance than other conventional methods. More importantly, Cox-nnet reveals much richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels, by analyzing features represented in the hidden layer nodes in Cox-nnet. Additionally, we propose to use hidden node features as a new approach for dimension reduction during survival data analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A prognostic model should not enter clinical practice unless it has been demonstrated that it performs a useful role. External validation denotes evaluation of model performance in a sample independent of that used to develop the model. Unlike for logistic regression models, external validation of Cox models is sparsely treated in the literature. Successful validation of a model means achieving satisfactory discrimination and calibration (prediction accuracy) in the validation sample. Validating Cox models is not straightforward because event probabilities are estimated relative to an unspecified baseline function.\n\nMETHODS: We describe statistical approaches to external validation of a published Cox model according to the level of published information, specifically (1) the prognostic index only, (2) the prognostic index together with Kaplan-Meier curves for risk groups, and (3) the first two plus the baseline survival curve (the estimated survival function at the mean prognostic index across the sample). The most challenging task, requiring level 3 information, is assessing calibration, for which we suggest a method of approximating the baseline survival function.\n\nRESULTS: We apply the methods to two comparable datasets in primary breast cancer, treating one as derivation and the other as validation sample. Results are presented for discrimination and calibration. We demonstrate plots of survival probabilities that can assist model evaluation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our validation methods are applicable to a wide range of prognostic studies and provide researchers with a toolkit for external validation of a published Cox model.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine the completeness of argumentative steps necessary to conclude effectiveness of an algorithm in a sample of current ML/AI supervised learning literature. Data Sources: Papers published in the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS, n\'ee NIPS) journal where the official record showed a 2017 year of publication. Eligibility Criteria: Studies reporting a (semi-)supervised model, or pre-processing fused with (semi-)supervised models for tabular data. Study Appraisal: Three reviewers applied the assessment criteria to determine argumentative completeness. The criteria were split into three groups, including: experiments (e.g real and/or synthetic data), baselines (e.g uninformed and/or state-of-art) and quantitative comparison (e.g. performance quantifiers with confidence intervals and formal comparison of the algorithm against baselines). Results: Of the 121 eligible manuscripts (from the sample of 679 abstracts), 99\% used real-world data and 29\% used synthetic data. 91\% of manuscripts did not report an uninformed baseline and 55\% reported a state-of-art baseline. 32\% reported confidence intervals for performance but none provided references or exposition for how these were calculated. 3\% reported formal comparisons. Limitations: The use of one journal as the primary information source may not be representative of all ML/AI literature. However, the NeurIPS conference is recognised to be amongst the top tier concerning ML/AI studies, so it is reasonable to consider its corpus to be representative of high-quality research. Conclusion: Using the 2017 sample of the NeurIPS supervised learning corpus as an indicator for the quality and trustworthiness of current ML/AI research, it appears that complete argumentative chains in demonstrations of algorithmic effectiveness are rare.},

abstract = {<p>As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progressed, distinct variants emerged and dominated in England. These variants, Wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron were characterized by variations in transmissibility and severity. We used a robust mathematical model and Bayesian inference framework to analyse epidemiological surveillance data from England. We quantified the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), therapeutics, and vaccination on virus transmission and severity. Each successive variant had a higher intrinsic transmissibility. Omicron (BA.1) had the highest basic reproduction number at 8.3 (95% credible interval (CrI) 7.7-8.8). Varying levels of NPIs were crucial in controlling virus transmission until population immunity accumulated. Immune escape properties of Omicron decreased effective levels of immunity in the population by a third. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies, we found Alpha had the highest basic infection fatality ratio (2.9%, 95% CrI 2.7-3.2), followed by Delta (2.2%, 95% CrI 2.0–2.4), Wildtype (1.2%, 95% CrI 1.1–1.2), and Omicron (0.7%, 95% CrI 0.6-0.8). Our findings highlight the importance of continued surveillance. Long-term strategies for monitoring and maintaining effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 are critical to inform the role of NPIs to effectively manage future variants with potentially higher intrinsic transmissibility and severe outcomes.</p>},

The paper compares the new landmark methodology as developed by the first author and the established multi-state modeling as described in a recent Tutorial in Biostatistics in Statistics in Medicine by the second author and colleagues. As expected the two approaches give similar results. The landmark methodology does not need complex modeling and leads to easy prediction rules. On the other hand, it does not give the insight in the biological processes as obtained for the multi-state model.},

Although this is sometimes plausible, we often wish to explore how robust our inferences are as this untestable assumption is relaxed. We describe how this can be carried out in a way that makes the assumptions accessible to all those involved in a research project. Estimation proceeds via multiple imputation, where censored failure times are imputed under user-specified departures from independent censoring. A novel aspect of our method is the use of bootstrapping to generate proper imputations from the Cox model. We illustrate our approach using data from an HIV-prevention trial and discuss how it can be readily adapted and applied in other settings.},

abstract = {The goals of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs are to maximally reduce cases and deaths, and to limit the amount of time required under lockdown. Using a mathematical model calibrated to data from King County Washington but generalizable across states, we simulated multiple scenarios with different vaccine efficacy profiles, vaccination rates, and case thresholds for triggering and relaxing partial lockdowns. We assumed that a contagious variant is currently present at low levels. In all scenarios, it rapidly becomes dominant by early summer. Low case thresholds for triggering partial lockdowns during current and future waves of infection strongly predict lower total numbers of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in 2021. However, in regions with relatively higher current seroprevalence, there is a predicted delay in onset of a subsequent surge in new variant infections. For all vaccine efficacy profiles, increasing vaccination rate lowers the total number of infections and deaths, as well as the total number of days under partial lockdown. Due to variable current estimates of emerging variant infectiousness, vaccine efficacy against these variants, vaccine refusal, and future adherence to masking and physical distancing, we project considerable uncertainty regarding the timing and intensity of subsequent waves of infection. Nevertheless, under all plausible scenarios, rapid vaccination and early implementation of partial lockdown are the two most critical variables to save the greatest number of lives.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementDrs.

@article{Steyerberg2010,
abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of different methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c ) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration. Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions. We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation). We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor},

abstract = {Deciding who should receive a liver transplant (LT) depends on both urgency and utility. Most survival scores are validated through discriminative tests, which compare predicted outcomes between patients. Assessing post-transplant survival utility is not discriminate, but should be “calibrated” to be effective. There are currently no such calibrated models. We developed and validated a novel calibrated model to predict individual survival after LT for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). We applied a software tool, PSSP, to adult patients in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (n = 2769) who received a LT for PSC between 2002 and 2013; this produced a model for predicting individual survival distributions for novel patients. We also developed an appropriate evaluation measure, D-calibration, to validate this model. The learned PSSP model showed an excellent D-calibration (p = 1.0), and passed the single-time calibration test (Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value of over 0.05) at 0.25, 1, 5 and 10 years. In contrast, the model based on traditional Cox regression showed worse calibration on long-term survival and failed at 10 years (Hosmer-Lemeshow p value = 0.027). The calculator and visualizer are available at: http://pssp.srv.ualberta.ca/calculator/liver_transplant_2002. In conclusion we present a new tool that accurately estimates individual post liver transplantation survival.},

abstract = {Predictive modelling and supervised learning are central to modern data science. With predictions from an ever-expanding number of supervised black-box strategies - e.g., kernel methods, random forests, deep learning aka neural networks - being employed as a basis for decision making processes, it is crucial to understand the statistical uncertainty associated with these predictions. As a general means to approach the issue, we present an overarching framework for black-box prediction strategies that not only predict the target but also their own predictions' uncertainty. Moreover, the framework allows for fair assessment and comparison of disparate prediction strategies. For this, we formally consider strategies capable of predicting full distributions from feature variables, so-called probabilistic supervised learning strategies. Our work draws from prior work including Bayesian statistics, information theory, and modern supervised machine learning, and in a novel synthesis leads to (a) new theoretical insights such as a probabilistic bias-variance decomposition and an entropic formulation of prediction, as well as to (b) new algorithms and meta-algorithms, such as composite prediction strategies, probabilistic boosting and bagging, and a probabilistic predictive independence test. Our black-box formulation also leads (c) to a new modular interface view on probabilistic supervised learning and a modelling workflow API design, which we have implemented in the newly released skpro machine learning toolbox, extending the familiar modelling interface and meta-modelling functionality of sklearn. The skpro package provides interfaces for construction, composition, and tuning of probabilistic supervised learning strategies, together with orchestration features for validation and comparison of any such strategy - be it frequentist, Bayesian, or other.},

abstract = {Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that deals with both, the tracking of time and of the survival status simultaneously as the dependent response. Current comparisons of survival model performance mostly center on clinical data with classic statistical survival models, with prediction accuracy often serving as the sole metric of model performance. Moreover, survival analysis approaches for censored omics data have not been thoroughly investigated. The common approach is to binarise the survival time and perform a classification analysis.Here, we develop a benchmarking framework, SurvBenchmark, that evaluates a diverse collection of survival models for both clinical and omics datasets. SurvBenchmark not only focuses on classical approaches such as the Cox model, but it also evaluates state-of-art machine learning survival models. All approaches were assessed using multiple performance metrics, these include model predictability, stability, flexibility and computational issues. Our systematic comparison framework with over 320 comparisons (20 methods over 16 datasets) shows that the performances of survival models vary in practice over real-world datasets and over the choice of the evaluation metric. In particular, we highlight that using multiple performance metrics is critical in providing a balanced assessment of various models. The results in our study will provide practical guidelines for translational scientists and clinicians, as well as define possible areas of investigation in both survival technique and benchmarking strategies.Contact jean.yang{at}sydney.edu.auCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards regression are commonly employed tools but are not appropriate for all studies, particularly in the presence of competing risks and when multiple or recurrent outcomes are of interest. Markov chain models can accommodate censored data, competing risks (informative censoring), multiple outcomes, recurrent outcomes, frailty, and non-constant survival probabilities.

@article{Vock2016,
abstract = {Models for predicting the probability of experiencing various health outcomes or adverse events over a certain time frame (e.g., having a heart attack in the next 5years) based on individual patient characteristics are important tools for managing patient care. Electronic health data (EHD) are appealing sources of training data because they provide access to large amounts of rich individual-level data from present-day patient populations. However, because EHD are derived by extracting information from administrative and clinical databases, some fraction of subjects will not be under observation for the entire time frame over which one wants to make predictions; this loss to follow-up is often due to disenrollment from the health system. For subjects without complete follow-up, whether or not they experienced the adverse event is unknown, and in statistical terms the event time is said to be right-censored. Most machine learning approaches to the problem have been relatively ad hoc; for example, common approaches for handling observations in which the event status is unknown include (1) discarding those observations, (2) treating them as non-events, (3) splitting those observations into two observations: one where the event occurs and one where the event does not. In this paper, we present a general-purpose approach to account for right-censored outcomes using inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). We illustrate how IPCW can easily be incorporated into a number of existing machine learning algorithms used to mine big health care data including Bayesian networks, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and generalized additive models. We then show that our approach leads to better calibrated predictions than the three ad hoc approaches when applied to predicting the 5-year risk of experiencing a cardiovascular adverse event, using EHD from a large U.S. Midwestern healthcare system.},

abstract = {When constructing new biomarker or gene signature scores for time-to-event outcomes, the underlying aims are to develop a discrimination model that helps to predict whether patients have a poor or good prognosis and to identify the most influential variables for this task. In practice, this is often done fitting Cox models. Those are, however, not necessarily optimal with respect to the resulting discriminatory power and are based on restrictive assumptions. We present a combined approach to automatically select and fit sparse discrimination models for potentially high-dimensional survival data based on boosting a smooth version of the concordance index (C-index). Due to this objective function, the resulting prediction models are optimal with respect to their ability to discriminate between patients with longer and shorter survival times. The gradient boosting algorithm is combined with the stability selection approach to enhance and control its variable selection properties.},

abstract = {Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs. Now on {CD}, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! Use the contents of the {CD} to create your own design documents and reusable components. The {CD} contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard {HTML} format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on {CD}-{ROM}. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the {CD} to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.},

abstract = {Survival analysis (time-to-event analysis) is widely used in economics and finance, engineering, medicine and many other areas. A fundamental problem is to understand the relationship between the covariates and the (distribution of) survival times(times-to-event). Much of the previous work has approached the problem by viewing the survival time as the first hitting time of a stochastic process, assuming a specific form for the underlying stochastic process, using available data to learn the relationship between the covariates and the parameters of the model, and then deducing the relationship between covariates and the distribution of first hitting times (the risk). However, previous models rely on strong parametric assumptions that are often violated. This paper proposes a very different approach to survival analysis, DeepHit, that uses a deep neural network to learn the distribution of survival times directly.DeepHit makes no assumptions about the underlying stochastic process and allows for the possibility that the relationship between covariates and risk(s) changes over time. Most importantly, DeepHit smoothly handles competing risks; i.e. settings in which there is more than one possible event of interest.Comparisons with previous models on the basis of real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DeepHit achieves large and statistically significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {Background Executive dysregulation and impulsivity can both predispose individuals to risk-prone actions. Although the risk of falls is well established in people with poor executive function, its association to impulsivity is less clear. Purpose To describe and assess the prognostic capabilities of the relationship between impulsivity, executive function, functional capability, and falls in the in-patient neurorehabilitation population. Materials and Methods A prospective cohort study in a 26-bed neurorehabilitation unit in London, recruiting 121 patients, of whom 94 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Cognitive-behavioural assessment was undertaken using the short (16-item) version of the Urgency-Premeditation-Perseverance-Sensation Seeking-Positive Urgency (UPPS) impulsive behaviour scale, and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Patients also underwent a functional assessment at admission and discharge using the UK Functional Independence and Assessment Measure tool (FIM + FAM). The main outcome of interest was falling during an in-patient episode, which are routinely recorded in a computerized registry of adverse incidents. Results Measurements of impulsivity (based on the UPPS-Short form) and executive function (based on the Trail Making Test) were not found to be significantly associated with functional improvement, or risk of falling. Predictive modelling experiments demonstrated that neither of the aforementioned results were capable of identifying individuals at risk of falling more accurately than an informed guess. Conclusion Where impulsivity is present, measurement using structured tools such as the UPPS may be informative to guide individualized rehabilitation programmes; however, its usefulness as the basis of risk prediction models for falls is less likely given the results of this study.},

abstract = {The conjunction of wireless computing, ubiquitous Internet access, and the miniaturisation of sensors have opened the door for technological applications that can monitor health and well-being outside of formal healthcare systems.  The health-related Internet of Things (H-IoT) increasingly plays a key role in health management by providing real-time tele-monitoring of patients, testing of  treatments, actuation of medical devices, and fitness and well-being monitoring.   Given its numerous applications and proposed benefits, adoption by medical and social care institutions and consumers may be rapid. However, a host of ethical concerns are also raised that must be addressed. The inherent sensitivity of health-related data being generated and latent risks of Internet-enabled devices pose serious challenges. Users, already in a vulnerable position as patients, face a seemingly impossible task to retain control over their data due to the scale, scope and complexity of systems that create, aggregate, and analyse personal health data. In response, the H-IoT must be designed to be technologically robust and scientifically reliable, while also remaining ethically responsible, trustworthy, and respectful of user rights and interests. To assist developers of the H-IoT, this paper describes nine principles and nine guidelines for ethical design of H-IoT devices and data protocols.},

abstract = {The proposed techniques investigate the strength of support vector regression (SVR) in cancer prognosis using imaging features. Cancer image features were extracted from patients and recorded into censored data. To employ censored data for prognosis, SVR methods are needed to be adapted to uncertain targets. The effectiveness of two principle breast features, tumor size and lymph node status, was demonstrated by the combination of sampling and feature selection methods. In sampling, breast data were stratified according to tumor size and lymph node status. Three types of feature selection methods comprised of no selection, individual feature selection, and feature subset forward selection, were employed. The prognosis results were evaluated by comparative study using the following performance metrics: concordance index (CI) and Brier score (BS). Cox regression was employed to compare the results. The support vector regression method (SVCR) performs similarly to Cox regression in three feature selection methods and better than Cox regression in non-feature selection methods measured by CI and BS. Feature selection methods can improve the performance of Cox regression measured by CI. Among all cross validation results, stratified sampling of tumor size achieves the best regression results for both feature selection and non-feature selection methods. The SVCR regression results, perform better than Cox regression when the techniques are used with either CI or BS. The best CI value in the validation results is 0.6845. The best CI value corresponds to the best BS value 0.2065, which were obtained in the combination of SVCR, individual feature selection, and stratified sampling of the number of positive lymph nodes. In addition, we also observe that SVCR performs more consistently than Cox regression in all prognosis studies. The feature selection method does not have a significant impact on the metric values, especially on CI. We conclude that the combinational methods of SVCR, feature selection, and sampling can improve cancer prognosis, but more significant features may further enhance cancer prognosis accuracy.},

Both compare the variance when a covariate is accounted for with the variance when it is ignored, but only the second incorporates differences between observed and fitted outcomes. First, the relationship between both measures is studied for the situation without censoring. It turns out that considering the explained variation as a process in time is helpful in this context as well as in its own right. Censoring is incorporated quite differently for the two measures.

abstract = {Abstract Identification of key factors associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and quantification of this risk using multivariable prediction algorithms are among the major advances made in preventive cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology in the 20th century. The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular risk prediction functions offer an important diagnostic tool for clinicians and patients themselves. They are usually constructed with the use of parametric or semi-parametric survival regression models. It is essential to be able to evaluate the performance of these models, preferably with summaries that offer natural and intuitive interpretations. The concept of discrimination, popular in the logistic regression context, has been extended to survival analysis. However, the extension is not unique. In this paper, we define discrimination in survival analysis as the model's ability to separate those with longer event-free survival from those with shorter event-free survival within some time horizon of interest. This definition remains consistent with that used in logistic regression, in the sense that it assesses how well the model-based predictions match the observed data. Practical and conceptual examples and numerical simulations are employed to examine four C statistics proposed in the literature to evaluate the performance of survival models. We observe that they differ in the numerical values and aspects of discrimination that they capture. We conclude that the index proposed by Harrell is the most appropriate to capture discrimination described by the above definition. We suggest researchers report which C statistic they are using, provide a rationale for their selection, and be aware that comparing different indices across studies may not be meaningful.},

abstract = {Summary. ROC curves are a popular method for displaying sensitivity and specificity of a continuous marker, X, for a binary disease variable, D. However, many disease outcomes are time dependent, D(t, and ROC curves that vary as a function of time may be mire appropriate. A common examples of a time-dependent variable is vital status, where D(t) = 1 if a patient has died prior to time t and zero otherwise. We propose summarizing the discrimination potential of a marker X, measured at baseline (t= 0), by calculating ROC Curves for cumulative disease or death incidence by time t, which we denote as ROC(t). A typical complexity with survival data is that observations may be censored. Two ROC curve estimators are proposed that can accommodate censored data. A simple estimator is based on using the Kaplan-Meier estimated for each possible subset X > c. However, this estimator does not guarantee the necessary condition that sensitivity and specificity are monotone in X. An alternative estimator that does guarantee monotonicity is based on a nearest neighbor estimator for the bivariate distribution function of (X, T), where T represents survival time (Akritas, M. J., 1994, Annals of Statistics22, 1299?1327). We present an example where ROC(t) is used to compare a standard and a modified flow cytometry measurement for predicting survival after detection of breast cancer and an example where the ROC(t) curve displays the impact of modifying eligibility criteria for sample size and power in HIV prevention trials.},

abstract = {Many health and safety problems, including war and terrorism, are by-products of how people reason about risk. I describe a new approach to reasoning about risk that implements a modern dual-process model of memory called fuzzy-trace theory. This approach posits encoding of both verbatim and gist representations, with reliance on the latter whenever possible; dependence of reasoning on retrieval cues that access stored values and principles; and vulnerability of reasoning to processing interference from overlapping classes of events, which causes denominator neglect in risk or probability judgments. These simple principles explain classic and new findings, for example, the finding that people overestimate small risks but ignore very small risks. Fuzzy-trace theory differs from other dual-process approaches to reasoning in that it places intuition at the apex of development, considering fuzzy intuitive processing more advanced than precise computational processing (e.g., trading off risks and rewards). The theory supplies a conception of rationality that distinguishes degrees of severity of errors in reasoning. It also includes a mechanism for achieving consistency in reasoning, a hallmark of rationality, by explaining how a person can treat superficially different reasoning problems in the same way if the problems share an underlying gist.},

abstract = {Because of censoring, standard methods of plotting individual survival times are invalid. Therefore, graphic display of time-to-event data usually takes the form of a Kaplan–Meier survival plot. Kaplan–Meier plots, however, make differences between groups seem larger than they really are. To overcome these limitations, we developed a technique for producing scatter plots with survival data and applied it to data from a randomized trial of patients with renal cancer. As of June 21, 2001, 25 of the 347 patients with kidney cancer in the Medical Research Council RE01 randomized treatment trial for whom data were available had been censored, and the remainder had died. Values of the censored survival times were imputed by assuming a log-normal distribution in survival times and by drawing a random sample given that that each patient with censored data survived at least to the point of censoring. The combined original and imputed data were then examined by use of dot plots and scatter plots. In the RE01 trial, median survival of patients treated with interferon was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval = 0.3 to 5.5 months) longer than that in patients treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Kaplan–Meier analysis showed clear separation between treatment groups and between prognostic groups. In contrast, comparisons of individual observed and imputed survival times between groups of patients showed considerable overlap and gave a more realistic idea of the modest between-group differences than Kaplan–Meier comparisons. These graphs of the distribution of survival times for individuals in each study group, which are simple to produce, may usefully complement Kaplan–Meier plots.},

abstract = {The usual method of estimating survival probabilities, namely the Kaplan-Meier method, is suboptimal in the analysis of deaths on the transplant waiting list. Death, transplantation, and withdrawal from list must all be considered. In this analysis, we applied the competing risk analysis method, which allows evaluating these end points individually and simultaneously, to compare the risk of waiting list death across era, blood types, liver disease diagnosis, and severity (Model for End-stage Liver Disease; MELD). Of 861 patients registered on the waiting list at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1990 and 1999, 657 (76%) patients underwent transplantation, 82 (10%) died while waiting, 41 (5%) withdrew from the list, and 81 (9%) patients were still waiting as of February 2002. The risk of death at 3 years was 10% by the competing risk analysis. During the study period, the median time to transplantation increased from 45 to 517 days. In univariate analyses, there was no significant difference in the risk of death by era of listing (P = .25) or blood type (P = .31), whereas the risk of death was significantly higher in patients with alcohol-induced liver disease and those with higher MELD score (P < .01). A multivariable analysis showed that after adjusting for MELD, blood type, and diagnosis, patients listed in the latter era had higher mortality. In conclusion, the competing risk analysis method is useful in estimating the risk of death among patients awaiting liver transplantation.},

abstract = {Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, nonproportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Akritas1994,
abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the bivariate distribution of the random vector $(X, Y)$ when $Y$ may be subject to random censoring. The censoring variable $C$ is allowed to depend on $X$ but it is assumed that $Y$ and $C$ are conditionally independent given $X = x$. The estimate of the bivariate distribution is obtained by averaging estimates of the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X = x$ over a range of values of $x$. The weak convergence of the centered estimator multiplied by $n^{1/2}$ is obtained, and a closed-form expression for the covariance function of the limiting process is given. It is shown that the proposed estimator is optimal in the Beran sense. This is similar to an optimality property the product-limit estimator enjoys. Using the proposed estimator of the bivariate distribution, an extension of the least squares estimator to censored data polynomial regression is obtained and its asymptotic normality established.},

abstract = {The authors compared five methods of studying survival bias associated with time-to-treatment initiation in a drug effectiveness study using medical administrative databases (1996–2002) from Quebec, Canada. The first two methods illustrated how survival bias could be introduced. Three additional methods were considered to control for this bias. Methods were compared in the context of evaluating statins for secondary prevention in elderly patients post-acute myocardial infarction who initiated statins within 90 days after discharge and those who did not. Method 1 that classified patients into users and nonusers at discharge resulted in an overestimation of the benefit (38% relative risk reduction at 1 year). In method 2, following users from the time of the first prescription and nonusers from a randomly selected time between 0 and 90 days attenuated the effect toward the null (10% relative risk reduction). Method 3 controlled for survival bias by following patients from the end of the 90-day time window; however, it suffered a major loss of statistical efficiency and precision. Method 4 matched prescription time distribution between users and nonusers at cohort entry. Method 5 used a time-dependent variable for treatment initiation. Methods 4 and 5 better controlled for survival bias and yielded similar results, suggesting a 20% risk reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction or death events.},

abstract = {The proportional hazards (PH) model is routinely employed for the analysis of time-to-event data in medical research when it is required to assess the effect of an intervention in the presence of covariates. The assumption of PH required for the PH approach may not hold, especially in circumstances where the effect of the intervention is to delay or accelerate the onset of an event rather than to reduce or increase the overall proportion of subjects who observe the event through time. If the assumption of PH is violated, the results from a PH model will be difficult to generalize to situations where the length of follow-up is different to that used in the analysis. It is also difficult to translate the results into the effect upon the expected median duration of illness for a patient in a clinical setting. The accelerated failure time (AFT) approach is an alternative strategy for the analysis of time-to-event data and can be suitable even when hazards are not proportional and this family of models contains a certain form of PH as a special case. The framework can allow for different forms of the hazard function and may provide a closer description of the data in certain circumstances. In addition, the results of the AFT model may be easier to interpret and more relevant to clinicians, as they can be directly translated into expected reduction or prolongation of the median time to event, unlike the hazard ratio. We recommend that consideration is given to an AFT modelling approach in the analysis of time-to-event data in medical research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe the relationship between type 2 diabetes and all-cause mortality among adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the critical care setting.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a nationwide retrospective cohort study in people admitted to hospital in England with COVID-19 requiring admission to a high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ICU) between 1 March 2020 and 27 July 2020. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate 30-day in-hospital all-cause mortality associated with type 2 diabetes, with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, and other major comorbidities (chronic respiratory disease, asthma, chronic heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, chronic neurological disease, chronic renal disease, and chronic liver disease).RESULTS A total of 19,256 COVID-19–related HDU and ICU admissions were included in the primary analysis, including 13,809 HDU (mean age 70 years) and 5,447 ICU (mean age 58 years) admissions. Of those admitted, 3,524 (18.3%) had type 2 diabetes and 5,077 (26.4%) died during the study period. Patients with type 2 diabetes were at increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.23 [95% CI 1.14, 1.32]), and this result was consistent in HDU and ICU subsets. The relative mortality risk associated with type 2 diabetes decreased with higher age (age 18–49 years aHR 1.50 [95% CI 1.05, 2.15], age 50–64 years 1.29 [1.10, 1.51], and age ≥65 years 1.18 [1.09, 1.29], P value for age–type 2 diabetes interaction = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS Type 2 diabetes may be an independent prognostic factor for survival in people with severe COVID-19 requiring critical care treatment, and in this setting the risk increase associated with type 2 diabetes is greatest in younger people.},

This problem involves analysing data of times to relapse of patients and relating them to prognostic variables. Some of the times to relapse will usually be censored.We investigate various ways of using neural network models to extend traditional statistical models in this situation. Such models are better able to model both non-linear effects of prognostic factors and interactions between them, than linear logistic or Cox regression models. With the dataset used in our study, however, the prediction of the risk of relapse is not significantly improved when using a neural network model. Predicting the risk that a patient will relapse within three years, say, is possible from this data, but not when any relapse will happen.},

abstract = {When developing a prediction model for survival data it is essential to validate its performance in external validation settings using appropriate performance measures. Although a number of such measures have been proposed, there is only limited guidance regarding their use in the context of model validation. This paper reviewed and evaluated a wide range of performance measures to provide some guidelines for their use in practice. An extensive simulation study based on two clinical datasets was conducted to investigate the performance of the measures in external validation settings. Measures were selected from categories that assess the overall performance, discrimination and calibration of a survival prediction model. Some of these have been modified to allow their use with validation data, and a case study is provided to describe how these measures can be estimated in practice. The measures were evaluated with respect to their robustness to censoring and ease of interpretation. All measures are implemented, or are straightforward to implement, in statistical software. Most of the performance measures were reasonably robust to moderate levels of censoring. One exception was Harrell's concordance measure which tended to increase as censoring increased. We recommend that Uno's concordance measure is used to quantify concordance when there are moderate levels of censoring. Alternatively, G{\"{o}}nen and Heller's measure could be considered, especially if censoring is very high, but we suggest that the prediction model is re-calibrated first. We also recommend that Royston's D is routinely reported to assess discrimination since it has an appealing interpretation. The calibration slope is useful for both internal and external validation settings and recommended to report routinely. Our recommendation would be to use any of the predictive accuracy measures and provide the corresponding predictive accuracy curves. In addition, we recommend to investigate the characteristics of the validation data such as the level of censoring and the distribution of the prognostic index derived in the validation setting before choosing the performance measures.},
annote = {Out of all the measures assessed, are there any that can/should be used to compare multiple Survival models (not necessarily Cox). e.g. is it meaningful to compare Uno's C or Gonen and Heller's between models to find the 'best' model. In this case does it still make sense to use the prognostic index in the function if the index is coming from a Weibull model vs Cox model? Is the interpretation the same...

Are there equivalents for AFTs that can be compared to PHs? Or is concordance index always the best and therefore the one measure that should be used?

Do we care at all about distance measures such as brier or logloss that instead compare the true time to event to the predicted time to event? As opposed to comparing the concordance of the linear predictor to the even time},

abstract = {In bagging, predictors are constructed using bootstrap samples from the training set and then aggregated to form a bagged predictor. Each bootstrap sample leaves out about 37% of the examples. These left-out examples can be used to form accurate estimates of important quantities. For instance, they can be used to give much improved estimates of node probabilities and node error rates in decision trees. Using estimated outputs instead of the observed outputs improves accuracy in regression trees. They can also be used to give nearly optimal estimates of generalization errors for bagged predictors. * Partially supported by NSF Grant 1-444063-21445 Introduction: We assume that there is a training set T= {(y n ,x n), n=1, ... ,N} and a method for constructing a predictor Q(x,T) using the given training set. The output variable y can either be a class label (classification) or numerical (regression). In bagging (Breiman[1996a]) a sequence of training sets T B,1 , ... , T B,K are generated of the same size as T by bootstrap selection from T. Then K predictors are constructed such that the kth predictor Q(x,T k,B) is based on the kth bootstrap training set. It was shown that if these predictors are aggregated--averaging in regression or voting in classification, then the resultant predictor can be considerably more accurate than the original predictor. Accuracy is increased if the prediction method is unstable, i.e. if small changes in the training set or in the parameters used in construction can result in large changes in the resulting predictor. The examples generated in Breiman[1996a] were based on trees and subset selection in regression, but it is known that neural nets are also unstable, as are other well-known prediction methods. Other methods such as nearest neighbors, are stable.},

Whilst there is a lot of promising research currently being undertaken, the literature as a whole lacks: transparency; clear reporting to facilitate replicability; exploration for potential ethical concerns; and, clear demonstrations of effectiveness. There are many reasons for why these issues exist, but one of the most important that we provide a preliminary solution for here is the current lack of ML/AI- specific best practice guidance. Although there is no consensus on what best practice looks in this field, we believe that interdisciplinary groups pursuing research and impact projects in the ML/AI for health domain would benefit from answering a series of questions based on the important issues that exist when undertaking work of this nature. Here we present 20 questions that span the entire project life cycle, from inception, data analysis, and model evaluation, to implementation, as a means to facilitate project planning and post-hoc (structured) independent evaluation. By beginning to answer these questions in different settings, we can start to understand what constitutes a good answer, and we expect that the resulting discussion will be central to developing an international consensus framework for transparent, replicable, ethical and effective research in artificial intelligence (AI-TREE) for health.},

abstract = {Summary.? Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

In this article we present inference procedures for evaluating such binary classification rules based on various prediction precision measures quantified by the overall misclassification rate, sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Specifically, under various working models, we derive consistent estimators for the above measures through substitution and cross-validation estimation procedures. Furthermore, we provide large-sample approximations to the distributions of these nonsmooth estimators without assuming that the working model is correctly specified. Confidence intervals, for example, for the difference of the precision measures between two competing rules can then be constructed.

abstract = {PURPOSENeoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been increasingly used in patients with locally advanced high-risk soft tissue sarcomas in the past decade, but definition and prognostic impact of a good histologic response (GHR) are lacking. Our aim was to investigate which histologic feature from the post-NAC surgical specimen independently correlated with metastatic relapse-free survival (MFS) in combination with clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features using a machine learning approach.METHODSThis retrospective study included 175 consecutive patients (median age: 59 years, 75 women) with resectable disease, treated with anthracycline-based NAC between 1989 and 2015 in our sarcoma reference center, and with quantitative histopathologic analysis of the surgical specimen. The outcome of interest was the MFS. A multimodel, multivariate survival analysis was used to define GHR. The added prognostic value of GHR was investigated through the comparisons with the standard model (including histologic grade, size, and depth) and SARCULATOR nomogram using concordance indices (c-index) and Monte-Carlo cross-validation.RESULTSSeventy-two patients (72 of 175, 41.1%) had a metastatic relapse. Stepwise Cox regression, random survival forests, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator?penalized Cox regression all converged toward the same definition for GHR, ie, < 5% stainable tumor cells. The five-year MFS probability was 1 (95% CI, 1 to 1) in patients with GHR versus 0.73 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.81) in patients without GHR (log-rank P = .0122). The final prognostic model incorporating the GHR was significantly better than the standard model and SARCULATOR (average c-index in testing sets = 0.72 [95% CI, 0.61 to 0.82] v 0.57 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.70] and 0.54 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.64], respectively; P = .0414 and .0091).CONCLUSIONHistologic response to NAC improves the prediction of MFS in patients with soft tissue sarcoma and represents a possible end point in future studies exploring innovative regimens in the neoadjuvant setting.},

The field of meteorology, where the paradigm of maximizing sharpness subject to calibration is popular, has addressed this problem by using scoring rules beyond MLE, such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). In this paper we present the \emph{Survival-CRPS}, a generalization of the CRPS to the survival prediction setting, with right-censored and interval-censored variants. We evaluate our ideas on the mortality prediction task using two different Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sets (STARR and MIMIC-III) covering millions of patients, with suitable deep neural network architectures: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for STARR and a Fully Connected Network (FCN) for MIMIC-III. We compare results between the two scoring rules while keeping the network architecture and data fixed, and show that models trained with Survival-CRPS result in sharper predictive distributions compared to those trained by MLE, while still maintaining calibration.},

abstract = {Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful1. Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.},

abstract = {Background: The widespread availability of new computational methods and tools for data analysis and predictive modeling requires medical informatics researchers and practitioners to systematically select the most appropriate strategy to cope with clinical prediction problems. In particular, the collection of methods known as 'data mining' offers methodological and technical solutions to deal with the analysis of medical data and construction of prediction models. A large variety of these methods requires general and simple guidelines that may help practitioners in the appropriate selection of data mining tools, construction and validation of predictive models, along with the dissemination of predictive models within clinical environments. Purpose: The goal of this review is to discuss the extent and role of the research area of predictive data mining and to propose a framework to cope with the problems of constructing, assessing and exploiting data mining models in clinical medicine. Methods: We review the recent relevant work published in the area of predictive data mining in clinical medicine, highlighting critical issues and summarizing the approaches in a set of learned lessons. Results: The paper provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art of predictive data mining in clinical medicine and gives guidelines to carry out data mining studies in this field. Conclusions: Predictive data mining is becoming an essential instrument for researchers and clinical practitioners in medicine. Understanding the main issues underlying these methods and the application of agreed and standardized procedures is mandatory for their deployment and the dissemination of results. Thanks to the integration of molecular and clinical data taking place within genomic medicine, the area has recently not only gained a fresh impulse but also a new set of complex problems it needs to address. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Before considering whether to use a multivariable (diagnostic or prognostic) prediction model, it is essential that its performance be evaluated in data that were not used to develop the model (referred to as external validation). We critically appraised the methodological conduct and reporting of external validation studies of multivariable prediction models.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles describing some form of external validation of one or more multivariable prediction models indexed in PubMed core clinical journals published in 2010. Study data were extracted in duplicate on design, sample size, handling of missing data, reference to the original study developing the prediction models and predictive performance measures.\n\nRESULTS: 11,826 articles were identified and 78 were included for full review, which described the evaluation of 120 prediction models. in participant data that were not used to develop the model. Thirty-three articles described both the development of a prediction model and an evaluation of its performance on a separate dataset, and 45 articles described only the evaluation of an existing published prediction model on another dataset. Fifty-seven percent of the prediction models were presented and evaluated as simplified scoring systems. Sixteen percent of articles failed to report the number of outcome events in the validation datasets. Fifty-four percent of studies made no explicit mention of missing data. Sixty-seven percent did not report evaluating model calibration whilst most studies evaluated model discrimination. It was often unclear whether the reported performance measures were for the full regression model or for the simplified models.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of studies describing some form of external validation of a multivariable prediction model were poorly reported with key details frequently not presented. The validation studies were characterised by poor design, inappropriate handling and acknowledgement of missing data and one of the most key performance measures of prediction models i.e. calibration often omitted from the publication. It may therefore not be surprising that an overwhelming majority of developed prediction models are not used in practice, when there is a dearth of well-conducted and clearly reported (external validation) studies describing their performance on independent participant data.},

abstract = {As machine learning has become increasingly popular over the last few decades, so too has the number of machine learning interfaces for implementing these models. Whilst many R libraries exist for machine learning, very few offer extended support for survival analysis. This is problematic considering its importance in fields like medicine, bioinformatics, economics, engineering, and more. mlr3proba provides a comprehensive machine learning interface for survival analysis and connects with mlr3's general model tuning and benchmarking facilities to provide a systematic infrastructure for survival modeling and evaluation.mlr3proba is available under an LGPL-3 license on CRAN and at https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3proba, with further documentation at https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/survival.html.},

In order to compare globally the observed and expected survival data the one-sample limit of Mantel's logrank test is formally derived. The statistic derived is identical to one proposed from a different viewpoint by Breslow (1975, International Statistical Review 43, 45-58).

abstract = {This study aims to identify the most and least significant prognostic factors for breast cancer survival analysis by means of feature evaluation indices derived from multilayer feedforward backpropagation neural networks (MLFFBPNN), fuzzy k-nearest neighbour classifier (FK-NN) and a logistic regression-based backward stepwise method (ER). The data used for the survival analysis were collected from 100 women who had been clinically diagnosed with breast disease in the form of carcinoma or benign conditions. The data set consists of seven different histological and cytological prognostic factors and two corresponding outputs to be predicted (whether the patient is alive or dead within 5 years of diagnosis). The MLFFBPNN, FK-NN and LR based indices identified different subsets of the factors as the most significant sets. We therefore suggest that it could be dangerous to rely on one method's outcome for assessment of such factors. It should also be noted that "S-phase fraction" (SPF) is the common cytological factor identified by all three methods while none of the three methods identified another cytological factor, namely "minimum (start) nuclear pleomorphism index" (NPI/sub min/). We, therefore, conclude that "S-phase fraction" and "minimum (start) nuclear pleomorphism index" appear to be the most and least important prognostic factors, respectively, for survival analysis in breast cancer patients, and should be investigated thoroughly in future clinical studies in oncology.},

abstract = {Objective To review and appraise the validity and usefulness of published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at increased risk of becoming infected with covid-19 or being admitted to hospital with the disease.Design Living systematic review and critical appraisal by the COVID-PRECISE (Precise Risk Estimation to optimise covid-19 Care for Infected or Suspected patients in diverse sEttings) group.Data sources PubMed and Embase through Ovid, arXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 5 May 2020.Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.Data extraction At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool).Results 14 217 titles were screened, and 107 studies describing 145 prediction models were included. The review identified four models for identifying people at risk in the general population; 91 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (60 were based on medical imaging, nine to diagnose disease severity); and 50 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, intensive care unit admission, ventilation, intubation, or length of hospital stay. The most frequently reported predictors of diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 are age, body temperature, lymphocyte count, and lung imaging features. Flu-like symptoms and neutrophil count are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while comorbidities, sex, C reactive protein, and creatinine are frequent prognostic factors. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.68 to 0.99 in prognostic models. All models were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting. Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed.Conclusion Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models for use in current practice. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones. The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.Systematic review registration Protocol https://osf.io/ehc47/, registration https://osf.io/wy245.Readers' note This article is a living systematic review that will be updated to reflect emerging evidence.

@article{Faraggi1997,
abstract = {Abstract Neural networks are considered by many to be very promising tools for classification and prediction. The flexibility of the neural network models often result in over-fit. Shrinking the parameters using a penalized likelihood is often used in order to overcome such over-fit. In this paper we extend the approach proposed by FARAGGI and SIMON (1995a) to modeling censored survival data using the input-output relationship associated with a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. Instead of estimating the neural network parameters using the method of maximum likelihood, we place normal prior distributions on the parameters and make inferences based on derived posterior distributions of the parameters. This Bayesian formulation will result in shrinking the parameters of the neural network model and will reduce the over-fit compared with the maximum likelihood estimators. We illustrate our proposed method on a simulated and a real example.},

abstract = {Abstract Measures of the predictive accuracy of regression models quantify the extent to which covariates determine an individual outcome. Explained variation measures the relative gains in predictive accuracy when prediction based on covariates replaces unconditional prediction. A unified concept of predictive accuracy and explained variation based on the absolute prediction error is presented for models with continuous, binary, polytomous and survival outcomes. The measures are given both in a model-based formulation and in a formulation directly contrasting observed and expected outcomes. Various aspects of application are demonstrated by examples from three forms of regression models. It is emphasized that the likely degree of absolute or relative predictive accuracy often is low even if there are highly significant and relatively strong covariates.

@article{Steyerberg2010,
abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of different methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c ) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration. Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions. We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation). We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor},

abstract = {We introduce a semi-parametric Bayesian model for survival analysis. The model is centred on a parametric baseline hazard, and uses a Gaussian process to model variations away from it nonparametrically, as well as dependence on covariates. As opposed to many other methods in survival analysis, our framework does not impose unnecessary constraints in the hazard rate or in the survival function. Furthermore, our model handles left, right and interval censoring mechanisms common in survival analysis. We propose a MCMC algorithm to perform inference and an approximation scheme based on random Fourier features to make computations faster. We report experimental results on synthetic and real data, showing that our model performs better than competing models such as Cox proportional hazards, ANOVA-DDP and random survival forests.},
